Movement is a fascinating phenomenon.
It integrates a deep, implicit \textit{feel} for the fundamental organisation of the universe, with surprising agency: that things, colloquially speaking, need not be the same, or different.
All animals move, whether actively or passively, at some stage of their lives.
As humans, we have projected our own motivations on to animals around us, and arrived at a relatively good understanding of why animals move, i.e., the ecological drivers of animal movement.
In this, we have the advantage of not being too far from our own past, before we had quite successfully insulated ourselves from the effects of such drivers.
This allows us to take the perspective of other animals when looking at a landscape; essentially, to mentally \textit{model} movement decisions across it.
