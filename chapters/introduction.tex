% Movement is a fascinating phenomenon.
% It integrates a deep, implicit \textit{feel} for the fundamental organisation of the universe, with surprising agency: that things, colloquially speaking, need not be the same, or different.
% All animals move, whether actively or passively, at some stage of their lives.
% As humans, we have projected our own motivations on to animals around us, and arrived at a relatively good understanding of why animals move, i.e., the ecological drivers of animal movement.
% In this, we have the advantage of not being too far from our own past, before we had quite successfully insulated ourselves from the effects of such drivers.
% This allows us to take the perspective of other animals when looking at a landscape; essentially, to mentally \textit{model} movement decisions across it.
