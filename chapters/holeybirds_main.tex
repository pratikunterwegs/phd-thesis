\lettrine{B}{irds} are unique in moving mostly by powered flight on feathered wings.
Feathers, unlike animal hair and claws, are dead proteinaceous structures, which cannot be renewed continuously as they suffer wear and tear \cite{rayner1988,jenni1989}.
As feathers mature, wing condition and consequently flight capacity gradually decreases \cite{lindstrom1994,hedenstrom1999,hedenstrom2003}.
Molt --- the shedding of old, worn-out feathers, and their replacement with freshly grown ones --- is thus a key process in avian ecology \cite{ginn1983,rayner1988}.
During wing molt, as one or more feathers are lost and new ones grow in their place, the flight surfaces of bird wings become smaller.
The reduction in flight surface area during molt can be measured using a robust-cross species index of the size of the (temporary) wing gap \citep{lind2001,kiat2016}.
Wider gaps lead to larger reductions in flight surface area, power output, and flight capacity and efficiency in captive birds \cite{tucker1991,swaddle1996,swaddle1997,williams2003,lind2001,lind2001a,bowlin2009}.
In addition to these indirect costs, wing molt is among the most energetically demanding phases of a bird's annual cycle, as regrowing large flight feathers requires substantial resources \cite{lindstrom1993,newton2009,kiat2017}.
Despite these mechanistic links between molt and movement, our understanding of molt's influence on birds' movement strategies and habitat selection is poor.

The direct influence of wing molt on the movement and habitat selection of birds has primarily been examined in a few small-scale, disconnected studies \citep{bell1970,haukioja1971,green1975,francis1991,madsen1987a,fox1998}.
Moving less, as some northerly species of finches and buntings do \citep{bell1970,haukioja1971,green1975,francis1991}, could save energy required to regrow feathers.
Avoiding predation risk during molt by sheltering in vegetation and rough terrain \citep{bell1970,haukioja1971,green1975,francis1991}, or near water-bodies as geese and ducks do \cite{madsen1987a,fox1998}, could also lead to reduced movement during molt.
Molt often coincides with migratory periods \citep{kiat2019}, making it difficult to separate the effects of migration-related energetic requirements \cite{alerstam1990,wikelski2003,horvitz2014}, such as preferences for high-quality resources \cite{madsen1987a,fox1998}, from molt-related considerations on habitat selection.
Simultaneously, molt is influenced by bird physiology, with large-bodied species molting faster \citep{kiat2021,jenni2020}, and also by birds' evolved movement strategies, as wide-ranging and aerial foraging species (e.g., swifts and swallows) molt more slowly to maintain movement capacity \cite{kiat2016}.

The direct effects of molt could be robustly studied with a cross-species comparison of unrelated, non-migratory species that are not constrained by the short time available for molt in northern temperate regions \cite{ginn1983,jenni2020}.
Cross-species studies of movement and habitat selection in molting birds could benefit from dramatic advances in the high-throughput position tracking of small species \cite{toledo2020,nathan2022}.
Birds, among other animals, can take the spatial perspective of visual predators, and avoid risky, exposed areas in favour of sheltered ones \cite{hampton1994,emery2000,krams2001,davidson2016,krams2020}.
Shelter is often only proxied by correlated variables, such as vegetation growth \cite{pettorelli2011}. 
Adopting a mechanistic, viewshed ecology approach \cite{olsoy2015,aben2018,aben2021} in habitat selection analyses could directly account for birds' visibility to potential predators \cite{olsoy2015,aben2018,aben2021}.

We explore the direct effects of wing molt on the movement of birds, focusing on four sympatric, non-migratory species: barn swallows (\textit{Hirundo rustica}), white-spectacled bulbuls (\textit{Pycnonotus xanthopygos}), house sparrows (\textit{Passer domesticus}), and clamorous reed-warblers (\textit{Acrocephalus stentoreus}).
Scoring the molt-related wing gap size of naturally molting birds \citep{lind2001,kiat2016}, we manipulated a subset of molting individuals by trimming a number of flight feathers.
We tracked birds during a 4-month period using the high-throughput ATLAS system, which brings unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution to small bird tracking \citep{toledo2014,weiser2016,toledo2020,nathan2022,beardsworth}.
We examined \textit{(i)} how the size of the molt-related wing gap affected bird movement, and \textit{(ii)} how the wing gap size influenced selection for more sheltered habitats.
Overall, we show how birds' movement decisions, influenced by their immediate physiological condition, scale up to affect their space use, and how individuals' adaptive behavioral strategies have feedbacks with their evolutionary ecology.

\section*{Methods}

We studied bird molt and movement in the Hula Valley of northern Israel (33.10°N, 35.60°E), which includes reconstructed wetlands and reedbeds as well as agricultural areas (crops, plantations and fishponds; see \textit{SI Appendix}).

\subsection{Bird capture, wing molt scoring and experimental manipulation}

We captured 86 individuals of four species in 2016: 16 barn swallows, 19 white-spectacled bulbuls, 35 house sparrows, and 16 clamorous reed-warblers, for which we also measured the wing gap index.
All individuals were trapped after breeding was completed and before the molting season commenced, between June and October 2016.

We described the state of each primary feather on a scale of 0 to 5 using the primary score (PS) method \citep{ginn1983}.
Both PS = 0 and PS = 5 indicate a fully mature feather, and hence no gap in the wing.
A PS value between 1 and 4 indicates feathers in increasing stages of growth, with PS = 1 representing a large gap left by a recently molted feather.
This method allows a cross-species estimate of the size of the molt-related gap in the wing, and is also strongly and negatively correlated with molt rate and duration \citep{rohwer2009}.
We scored the wing gap size due to any single feather molting as the inverse value of PS for each of the wing's nine primary feathers (P1 -- P9; counted outward) such that when PS = 1, wing gap size = 4, and when PS = 2, wing gap size = 3, etc.
However, for PS = 0, wing gap size is also 0 because there is no gap in both the PS = 0 and PS = 5 stages, as either an old, mature feather, or a new, freshly grown feather is present.
To compare molt-related wing gap sizes across individual birds, we summed the wing gap size scores across all nine primary flight feathers, for each individual, into a single wing gap index \citep{kiat2016}.
This index is independent of the size of individual birds and their morphology, controls for the stage of wing feather molt, and allows for reliable cross-species comparisons \citep{bensch1993,kiat2016}.

We experimentally manipulated 29 individuals across species {(bulbuls = 6, sparrows = 14, reed-warblers = 2, swallows = 7)}, and removed one to three primaries; the exact number was determined randomly for each bird.
We varied this number to produce variation in the possible effect of wing gap size, and the manipulation was symmetrical, i.e., the same feather was removed in both wings.
Primaries were removed by cutting the feather near its base, in addition to the primaries missing as part of natural molt; this procedure simulates an enlargement of the molt-related wing gap.
Cutting the feather rather than tearing it out from the base, which is still innervated \cite{jenni2020}, avoided excess trauma which could impact birds' behaviour, and allowed us to examine the effect of only the wing gap size on movement and habitat selection.
For these experimentally manipulated birds, we calculated the wing gap size after the procedure described here.
Bird capture and handling, the experimental manipulation procedure, and tagging for position tracking (see below) were conducted under a permit from the Israel Nature and Parks Authority (NPA permit 2016/41402) and from the ethics committee of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel (NS-16-14801-2).

\subsection{Forecasting daily changes in the wing gap size index}

The size of the molt-related wing gap decreases slowly and constantly as feathers regrow, yet as a mature feather is shed, the wing gap size may also increase in gradual jumps.
Over our tracking period of about 7 days per individual (see below), this is expected to represent small changes in the wing surface area, which could further influence movement decisions.
These changes in wing condition should be accounted for when relating movement characteristics to wing gap size.
To do this, we calculated for each species the mean daily progress in the molt score, based on a sample of individuals documented twice during the molt process (bulbul = 0.45 $\pm$ 0.15, n = 17; sparrow = 0.40 $\pm$ 0.25, n = 10; reed-warbler = 0.69 $\pm$ 0.34, n = 24; swallow = 0.34 $\pm$ 0.18, n = 22). 
Then, we estimated for each bird included in the study the expected daily change based on the measurement we made at the time of tagging (see \textit{SI Appendix}).

\subsection{Tracking bird movement using ATLAS}

We tracked the movement of individual birds using ATLAS (Advanced Tracking and Localization of Animals in real-life Systems), a state-of-the-art high-throughput radio-telemetry system capable of tracking dozens of individuals at intervals as low as 4 seconds \citep{weiser2016,toledo2014,toledo2020,nathan2022}.
We glued ATLAS tags (0.9 -- 1.6 g, depending on species) to birds' dorsal feathers after capture, and then released them (tag weights as percent of body mass: bulbuls = 3.85\% $\pm$ 0.21\%; sparrows = 4.21 $\pm$ 0.13; reed-warblers = 4.75\% $\pm$ 0.19\%; swallows = 4.9\% $\pm$ 0.13\%).
Tags automatically drop off as these feathers are molted.
Each individual was tracked for an average of 8.23 $\pm$ 3.24 days (bulbul = 9.8 $\pm$ 10.1 days; sparrow = 12.0 $\pm$ 13.4 days; reed-warbler = 5.9 $\pm$ 2.1 days; swallow = 5.1 $\pm$ 14.8 days).
We collected 4.3 million position estimates overall, with 7,276 positions per individual per day, for an effective tracking interval of 5.05 $\pm$ 1.85 positions per minute on average (bulbuls = 6.14 $\pm$ 3.93; sparrows = 5.98 $\pm$ 5.57; reed warblers = 5.80 $\pm$ 3.16; swallows = 2.28 $\pm$ 1.42).
Since we were interested in exploring movement patterns, and these species are diurnally active, we removed all nighttime positions, leading to an approximate halving of the total dataset.

\subsection{Processing tracking data}

ATLAS conservatively filters out location estimates that are clearly wrong (e.g., too far from the study area), letting users inspect most location estimates, which come with several measures of quality, 
% (estimated covariance matrix, quality of fit to constraints, and the norm of the gradient of the objective function), 
and decide whether they want to retain the estimates or not. 
For this study, we aggressively filtered out location estimates, removing estimates for which we had indications that ATLAS failed to find a high-quality estimate \citep{gupte2022d} (see \emph{log\_preprocessing.log} in the analysis code).
We began data cleaning by removing locations near a so-called attractor position (at (257000.0,780000.0), Israeli grid; see file \textit{log\_preprocessing.log}); these are locations for which the positioning system had defaulted to a (wrong) estimate.
We identified and removed other attractor positions by removing positions sharing the exact same common coordinate pair. 
Since coordinates are resolved down to double-precision, it is very unlikely for two location estimates to have the same coordinate pair, and this rather indicates an error in location estimation.
Each individual's track was pre-processed separately.

We first \textit{(i)} filtered the data for large-scale errors by removing positions with a system-generated positioning-error estimate (SD) $>$ 20m, and then \textit{(ii)} split each individual's tracking data by calendar date, removing days with $<$ 500 positions. 
Finally, we \textit{(iii)} filtered the data for unrealistic movements, removing positions with both speeds $>$ 20 m/s \emph{and} a turning angle >10\textdegree.
We deliberately used larger thresholds than these species' maximum speeds to avoid removing valid, high-speed movements \citep{gupte2022d}.
Finally, we \textit{(iv)} accounted for small-scale errors --- noise around the true positions --- by applying a median smooth with a moving window $K$ = 7.
After excluding night time data and all other data filtering and smoothing, we analyzed 1.1 million locations from 86 individuals, keeping high per-minute sampling rate for all species (bulbuls = 4.85 $\pm$ 3.3, sparrows = 2.73 $\pm$ 3.0, reed-warblers = 2.09 $\pm$ 1.44, swallows = 2.07 $\pm$ 1.14).
Compared with current technologies for tracking small birds ($<$ 50g) --- primarily radio triangulation and geolocators, which have low temporal (a few fixes per hour or day) and spatial resolution (error margins up to 200 km) \citep{bridge2013} --- ATLAS data represent an unprecedented sampling rate, with GPS-level accuracy \citep{beardsworth}.

\subsection{Quantifying large-scale movements}

We investigated the large-scale space-use of bulbuls, sparrows, and reed-warblers by summarising their processed movement paths into daily sequences of `residence patches' using the \textit{atlastools} package developed specifically with high-throughput ATLAS tracking data in mind \citep{gupte2022d}.
The residence patch algorithm uses simple distance and duration thresholds, chosen based on the movement ecology of the tracked species, to efficiently and rapidly cluster-segment individuals' non-travelling positions \citep{gupte2022d}.
We applied this algorithm to the date-specific tracks of each individual, considering consecutive positions less than 25m and 30 minutes apart to be part of the same cluster.
We joined clusters (with at least 9 positions) less than 100m and 30 minutes apart together for bulbuls and sparrows, and less than 25m and 30 minutes apart for reed warblers, which typically fly only short distances \cite{kiat2016}.
Doing so, we obtained 4,373 residence patches overall and extracted environmental covariates (NDVI and visibility index; see below) for the positions clustered into each patch.
%%
We handled swallows differently, as these are highly aerial birds whose movement is not easily clustered into residence patches.
Instead, and because the relatively higher-flying swallows are more accurately tracked by ATLAS, we simply calculated the total distances moved along daily tracks from the cleaned, processed data.

\subsection{Visibility analysis to quantify sheltered habitats}

Many animals can gauge the risk posed by predators by estimating a predator's field of view (`spatial perspective taking') \cite{emery2000,bruce2003,davidson2016}, and select for sheltered locations outside of a predator's view \citep{hampton1994,krams2001,watve2002}.
To assess the field of view of a hypothetical predator, and thus the estimated riskiness of the landscape, we took a viewshed ecology approach to determine how visible an area was from surrounding locations \citep{aben2018,aben2021}.

We first obtained a 50cm canopy height model (CHM) \citep{aben2021} of the majority of our study area (courtesy of the Survey of Israel).
For each cell of the CHM, we calculated a \textit{visibility index}, which is the proportion of surrounding cells from which the focal cell is visible, given that lines of sight can be blocked by intervening structures (also called cumulative viewshed analysis, or a `fearscape') \cite{olsoy2015}.
Open areas, such as agricultural fields or water bodies, are likely to be visible from all directions and have a visibility score $\approx$ 1.0.
In contrast, locations inside woodland or reedbeds are likely to be hidden from view, with a lower visibility index (see \textit{SI Appendix}).

Importantly, the visibility index depends upon the hypothetical observer's height above surface level; observers higher up may be able to see locations that are obstructed from a terrestrial viewpoint.
We parameterised our visibility index calculations based on the hunting flight altitude of a raptor that commonly preys on small birds, the Eurasian sparrowhawk (\textit{Accipiter nisus}).
Sparrowhawks and other bird-preying raptors hunt by surprising their prey via low-level flight, as hovering or high-flying raptors are conspicuous and can be easily detected \cite{krams2001,krams2020}.
In line with experimental and observational work, we assumed an observer height of 1.5m above surfaces (tree canopy, fields, or other) \citep{seress2011,krams2020}, and an observer visual range of 50m.
We used the `Visibility Analysis' plugin v1.2 for QGIS v3.20 to calculate visibility scores over the study area \citep{cuckovic2016}.

\subsection{Drawing alternative residence patches to examine habitat selection}

In our landscape, it is mostly wooded areas that offer shelter from observation by aerial predators (see \textit{SI Appendix}).
We examined the relative importance of the provisioning effects of vegetation (proxied by NDVI) \cite{pettorelli2011}, and its sheltering effects (section F above), on birds' movement decisions at the patch scale.
To do this, we combined our residence patch approach for bulbuls, sparrows, and reed warblers with a step-selection approach \citep{thurfjell2014,avgar2016} using the \textit{amt} package \citep{signer2019}.
While barn swallows could potentially make use of sheltering vegetation by flying very low \cite{warrick2016}, we could not detect their altitude above the ground --- a key component of shelter --- and so did not include them in this analysis.

We first converted each individual's daily sequence of residence patches into steps, with each patch $i$ as the starting point, and the following patch $i+1$ as the end of the step.
Then, for each such real step, we drew 9 alternative steps that the individual could have taken from patch $i$, and considered the end coordinates of these alternative steps to represent the median coordinates of a potential residence patch.
The distances of these movements were drawn from a gamma distribution fitted to each individual's movements between patches, and turning angles were drawn from a von Mises distributions fitted to the observed turning angles \citep{signer2019}.
For each alternative patch with median coordinates ($X_\text{alt}, Y_\text{alt}$), we drew 15 coordinate pairs from a normal distribution centred on ($X_\text{alt}, Y_\text{alt}$), with a standard deviation of 20 m.

To control for the resource-provisioning effect of vegetation, we also obtained the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a metric of vegetation growth \citep{pettorelli2011} across our study area, using Copernicus Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument, Level-1C data (10m resolution; June -- October 2016).
We sampled the NDVI and visibility index at real and potential patch coordinates, and calculated averages per patch.
With between-patch movements as steps, we performed species- and molt-status specific step-selection analysis (SSA) to determine how these predictors affected habitat selection (see \textit{SI Appendix}) \cite{avgar2016}.
The time intervals between patches were not fixed, but step lengths were not dependent on step duration, and so we implemented a simple SSA.

\section*{Results}

\subsection*{Molt-related wing gap size}

\begin{figure}[!t]

\caption{
    \textbf{Naturally molting bulbuls and sparrows, but not reed-warblers, move farther between residence patches during natural molt than following experimental feather manipulation.}
    White-spectacled bulbuls (\textit{Pycnonotus xanthopygos}) and house sparrows (\textit{Passer domesticus}) moved 251\% and 150\% as far between areas of prolonged use (`residence patches') when molting, compared to non-molting individuals (see text for statistics).
    %generalised additive model estimates: bulbuls, $F$ = 4.734, p = 0.01; sparrows, $F$ = 11.58, p < 0.001).
    However, when bulbuls' and sparrows' wings were heavily compromised by experimental manipulation (wing gap index $\geq$ 12), both species made shorter movements between residence patches.
    In contrast, clamorous reed-warblers (\textit{Acrocephalus stentoreus}) did not show a significant difference in large-scale movements with increasing wing gap index, possibly because they are already restricted to small patches of reedbeds.
}\label{fig1}
\end{figure}

Of the four species we studied, bulbuls and sparrows are relatively wide-ranging birds, reed-warblers are strongly range restricted to patchy reedbeds, and swallows are very wide-ranging, largely aerial foragers.
Bulbuls and sparrows molt more slowly than reed-warblers, but more rapidly than swallows.
Thus reed-warblers have the largest molt-related wing gaps, swallows the smallest, while bulbuls and sparrows are intermediate between them {(wing gap index, mean $\pm$ SD: swallows = 4.3 $\pm$ 0.95, bulbuls = 4.95 $\pm$ 1.37, sparrows = 5.9 $\pm$ 2.1, reed warblers = 9.5 $\pm$ 1.38)}.
All non-molting birds had a wing gap index score of zero.

\subsection*{Molt-related wing gap size and large-scale movements}

For bulbuls, sparrows, and reed-warblers, we quantified large-scale movements as both the displacements between areas of prolonged residence, called `residence patches' \cite{gupte2022d}, as well as the frequency of these displacements.
Since swallows constantly fly while foraging, we chose to quantify their large-scale movement by simply calculating the total distance moved, adjusting for the daily duration of daytime tracking.
We related total large-scale movements (controlling for daily, daytime tracking duration) with wing gap size using generalised additive models (GAM).
We fit one GAM for bulbuls, sparrows, and reed-warblers (species included as both fixed and random effect), and a separate GAM for swallows (see \textit{Methods}; see \textit{SI Appendix} for model specification).

        \textbf{Patch-switching behaviour is affected by wing gap size in bulbuls and sparrows, but not in reed-warblers.}

        Reed-warblers did not show a significant difference in patch switching with increasing wing gap index, possibly because they are already restricted to small patches of reedbeds.
    }\label{fig2}
\end{figure}

\paragraph*{Distance between residence patches}

We found that bulbuls and sparrows, but not reed-warblers, adjusted their daytime large-scale movements between residence patches to their wing gap size (Fig.~\ref{fig1}; GAM t-value = 2.13, p = 0.034; \textit{SI Appendix} Table S1).
Compared with non-molting individuals (wing gap = 0), naturally molting bulbuls with moderately large molt-related gaps (3 $<$ wing gap $\leq$ 10) actually moved 2.5 times as far per hour between residence patches (GAM estimate $F$ = 4.734, p = 0.01; distance between patches: non-molting = 54.11 m, molting = 135.89 m).
Similarly, naturally molting sparrows moved {1.5 times} as far per hour between residence patches (GAM estimate $F$ = 11.58, p = 0.00002; distance between patches: non-molting = 208 m, molting = 307 m).
This is consistent with the idea that wing molt is an energetically demanding period that requires actively seeking out high-quality food sources \citep{madsen1987a,fox1998}.

Reed-warblers and swallows, which represent very rapid and very slow molt rates, respectively, showed no statistically significant change in large-scale movement with increasing size of the molt-related wing gap (Fig.~\ref{fig1}: reed-warblers).
Rapidly-molting reed-warblers moved similar distances between residence patches when molting or non-molting (GAM estimate $F$ = 0.055, p = 0.815; Fig.~\ref{fig1}).
This is presumably because reed-warblers 
% are already very strongly constrained to a few clustered reedbed habitats, and thus 
do not move between distant patches even when not molting (mean distance between residence patches: non-molting = 27.20 m, molting = 29.09 m, manipulated = 8.49 m) \citep{kiat2016}.
Slow-molting swallows also moved similar (large) distances per hour when they were either non-molting, molting, or artificially manipulated (GAM estimate $F$ = 0.129, p = 0.723).
Swallows' slow molt rate likely represents an adaptation to their aerial foraging habit, allowing them to maintain flight performance across molt stages (non-molting = 3.48 $\pm$ 1.36 km, molting = 3.36 $\pm$ 1.17 km, manipulated = 3.64 $\pm$ 1.96 km).

\paragraph*{Effect of artificial manipulation}

Our experimental manipulation involved removal of one to three primaries, in addition to the primaries missing as part of natural molt (see \emph{Methods}).
Wing gap index scores after artificial manipulation showed differences among species corresponding to their natural molt rate, manipulated reed warblers had larger wing gaps than manipulated swallows, bulbuls, or sparrows {(swallows = 10.11 $\pm$ 2.5, bulbuls = 13.5 $\pm$ 2.35, sparrows = 12.56 $\pm$ 3.5, reed-warblers = 17.8 $\pm$ 1.1).}
Bulbuls and sparrows whose flight feathers had been removed by manipulation (12 $<$ wing gap $<$ 20) moved shorter distances than naturally molting birds {(bulbuls: 68\% less, 43 m; sparrows: 16.7\% less, 256 m)}.
% Bulbuls especially barely moved at all between residence patches when their wings were heavily compromised by artificial manipulation (wing gap $>$ 15; mean distance between residence patches / hr = 39.3 $\pm$ 42.2 m; Fig.~\ref{fig1}).
These observations are in line with the direct effects of severely reduced flight capacity and allocating energy reserves to feather regrowth rather than movement, and an indirect effect of risk-avoidance during a vulnerable period.

\paragraph*{Frequency of patch switching}

We found that in addition to affecting the distance moved between residence patches, the wing gap resulting from natural molt or manipulation also affected the frequency of patch switching in bulbuls and sparrows, but not in reed-warblers (Fig.~\ref{fig2}).
Naturally molting bulbuls moved more often between residence patches than non-molting and artifically manipulated birds (GAM estimate $F$ = 7.45, p $<$ 0.001; see also \textit{SI Appendix} Table S2).
However, naturally molting sparrows switched between residence patches as often as non-molting birds, but artificially manipulated sparrows switched patches less frequently than molting birds (GAM estimate $F$ = 3.515, p = 0.024; Fig.~\ref{fig2}).
Reed-warblers did not show a change in patch-switching frequency in relation to wing gap size (GAM estimate $F$ = 1.04, p = 0.31).

        %(GAM parametric estimate = 0.05, p = 0.86).

\end{figure}

\subsection*{Molt-related wing gap size and patch occupancy}

We examined whether the time that bird spent in residence patches was affected by their wing gap size, with the expectation --- following the results for movements between patches --- that molting birds would spend less time in patches than non-molting and manipulated birds (see \textit{SI Appendix} for model specification).
This was indeed the case for both bulbuls and reed-warblers, for which the mean patch duration for molting birds was only about half of that for non-molting and manipulated birds (Fig.~\ref{fig3}; GAM estimates: bulbuls, $F$ = 18.86, p $<$ 0.001; reed warblers, $F$ = 12.854, p $<$ 0.001).
However, we found that sparrows had similar patch durations across different wing gap sizes (GAM estimate $F$ = 0.023, p = 0.878; \textit{SI Appendix} Table S3).

We expected two environmental attributes --- vegetation productivity (NDVI), and visibility to predators --- to also affect patch durations.
To quantify patch visibility, we calculated the visibility index across our study area \cite{olsoy2015,aben2018,aben2021}.
The visibility index represents whether a location can be observed from surrounding areas, for example by a commonly occurring predator, the Eurasian Sparrowhawk (\textit{Accipiter nisus}; see \textit{Methods}).
Areas with taller vegetation such as orchards, and built-up areas such as settlements have lower visibility indices and are more sheltered (see \textit{SI Appendix}), as predators' lines of sight are obstructed by intervening objects \cite{olsoy2015}.
We found that NDVI did not appear to influence patch duration (GAM parametric estimate = 0.056, p = 0.86).
However, patch durations increased with reduced patch visibility (GAM parametric estimate = -0.70, p = 0.004).

\subsection*{Birds occupy sheltered areas across molt rates}

Finding that patch visibility influenced patch durations, we examined whether birds' molt-related wing gaps directly influenced their use of sheltered areas (except swallows, which are aerial foragers).
First, fitting a GAM with species-specific smooths for bulbuls, sparrows, and reed-warblers (see \textit{Methods}), we found that only reed-warblers had slightly more sheltered patches with larger wing gaps (GAM estimate $F$ = 9.30, p = 0.002; Fig.~\ref{fig4}; visibility: non-molting = 0.33 $\pm$ 0.17, molting = 0.31 $\pm$ 0.19, manipulated = 0.21 $\pm$ 0.06), potentially because their rapid molt rate severely reduces flight capacity and makes increased shelter necessary.
% only a moderate overall relationship between the visibility index of residence patches and the size of the molt-related wing gap (GAM t-value = 100.5, p $<$ 0.001; $R^2$ = 0.312).
This suggests that bulbuls and sparrows, with intermediate molt rates, occupy sheltered areas of similar (low) visibility regardless of the size of their wing gap (visibility: bulbuls =  0.39 $\pm$ 0.18; sparrows = 0.47 $\pm$ 0.19; see \textit{SI Appendix} Table S4).

We went one step further, and used a step-selection approach to sample patches to which individuals could have moved, and estimated birds' relative preference for visibility and NDVI when making movement decisions (see \textit{Methods}) \citep{avgar2016,aben2021}.
Fitting separate step-selection functions for each species and each broad molt group (non-molting, molting, and manipulated), we found that across molt group, all three species preferred low-visibility sheltered sites over higher visibility ones (Fig.~\ref{fig4}; \textit{SI Appendix} Table S5).
Furthermore, NDVI did not signficantly affect birds' movement decisions at the patch scale (see \textit{SI Appendix} Table {S1}).
This is consistent with the idea that birds of our study species mostly avoid open agricultural fields, where they might be exposed to potential predators, even though fields are highly productive.

    Across the three species, a GAM indicated that molt-related wing gap index was a poor predictor of the visibility of areas actually occupied by individuals (`real' residence patches; small colored circles). 
    A step-selection analysis at patch level, comparing real residence patches to sampled potential residence patches (grey crosses), showed strong selection for patches with low visibility index scores for all wing conditions, indicated by negative estimated selection coefficients ($\beta$ = natural logarithm of relative selection strength). 
    All $\beta$ values were statistically significant (see \textit{SI Appendix}).

\section*{Discussion}

Our study is among the first to quantify how the compromised wing surface associated with molt directly affects movement and habitat selection in wild birds.
Our high-throughput tracking system enabled tracking small birds at temporal (several times per minute) and spatial resolutions (a few metres) far surpassing current technologies for tracking such small birds ($<$ 50g) --- mainly through radio triangulation and geolocators, that have low temporal (a few fixes per hour or day, respectively) and spatial resolution (error margins up to 200 km) \citep{bridge2013}.
Focusing on resident birds outside their breeding season, rather than migratory or breeding ones, enables at least some control on confounding factors associated with seasonal physiological changes, and the confounding effect of migration- or breeding-related energy and time requirements \cite{alerstam1990,wikelski2003,horvitz2014}.
Our study also extends the geographic range of the field to an understudied region, and to two less-studied species.

Both rapidly molting clamorous reed-warblers, and slow-molting barn swallows, did not adjust their large-scale movements to their wing condition.
Reed-warblers move very short distances ($<$ 25m) in low-visibility areas, and can afford rapid, resource-intensive feather growth \citep{lindstrom1993,newton2009,kiat2017}, as this does not compromise their ability to move scansorially through their dense reedbed habitat, which also offers shelter from visual predators.
At the other extreme, barn swallows that forage exclusively while flying have evolved a very slow molt rate \cite{kiat2016}, which likely forestalls significant direct aerodynamic effects of feather loss on flight capacity.
Our work shows how birds' evolved molt strategies --- which are themselves influenced by movement strategies \cite{kiat2016} --- are interlinked with the direct, short-term effects of molt on movement.

We also found that birds with intermediate molt rates --- white-spectacled bulbuls and house sparrows --- adapt their movement strategies to their wing morphology.
Surprisingly, these species moved more when naturally molting than non-molting.
Birds can compensate for lower wing power output by growing their pectoral muscles, and this may allow them to maintain flight capacity during the molt, enabling increased movement to find resources for feather growth \cite{chai1997,swaddle1997}.
Unsurprisingly, increased movements between putative foraging patches, and an increased frequency of such movements, together translate into a shorter occupancy duration in each patch.
While this movement strategy conforms with optimal foraging theory --- rapid abandonment of patches to maximize prey intake \cite{charnov1976} --- it does not appear that vegetation productivity influences patch use.

When increased movement for high quality resources \cite{charnov1976} cannot compensate for the costs of inefficient flight and feather growth, moving less overall to conserve energy may be the optimal strategy until new flight feathers develop.
This latter strategy should be expected when the wing gap size is increased beyond the extent of natural molt, as found in our study.
The shorter between-patch movements of artificially manipulated sparrows and bulbuls with especially large wing gaps (wing gap index $>$ 12), compared with natural molt, thus fit within this hypothesis.
Importantly, our relatively non-invasive method only increases the wing's feather gap size while avoiding wing injury, suggesting that the reduction in flight is actually due to considerations of flight efficiency, rather than trauma.

We have for the first time applied the idea of the cumulative viewshed to directly assess the availability of shelter from visual predators, along birds' real and potential movement paths \cite{olsoy2015}.
Birds, like other animals, are capable of taking the spatial perspective of other individuals \cite{emery2000,krams2001,watve2002,davidson2016}, i.e., whether a location would be visible to another observer, such as a predator \citep{watve2002,olsoy2015}.
Previous work has focused on demonstrating spatial perspective taking --- and resulting habitat selection --- at small spatial scales of a few metres, and typically with a direct predator cue \cite{krams2001,watve2002}.
Our work is the first to combine the spatial perspective-taking concept with the emerging framework of animal viewshed ecology at landscape scales \cite{aben2018,aben2021}.
Our findings suggest that birds can estimate the visibility (and hence riskiness) of an area from multiple perspectives, and that they can do so at relatively large, landscape scales (many dozens of metres).
Our results also show how the modelling of animal movement decisions should incorporate individuals' estimates of what \textit{other animals} can see \cite{hampton1994,emery2000}.
Visibility analysis provides a simple, mechanistic way to incorporate animals' potential assessments of landscape risk into habitat selection models.
This could help move away from purely correlative studies of animal habitat selection, which usually rely on predictors with very broad applicability \cite{pettorelli2011}.

All three species studied strongly preferred sheltered, low-visibility habitats over more open sites, even when the available sites had similar vegetation productivity.
Predators are unlikely to always be in the vicinity of a specific location, or indeed to always be visible.
This instead points to an avoidance of open agricultural areas where predation risk is highest, showing the immediate, small-scale effects of a `fearscape' \cite{olsoy2015} on animal movement.
This pre-emptive caution may explain why wing condition, which should be expected to determine vulnerability to predation, did not lead to more sheltered residence patches in two of three relevant species.
Furthermore, our findings suggest that avoidance of high-visibility areas may be an overlooked, yet potentially broadly applicable mechanism by which agricultural `green deserts' exclude avian biodiversity.
An unwillingness to break cover from sheltered areas, and move through high-visibility habitat, may explain how individual movement decisions can scale up to restrict animal space use, from short home-range moves to longer dispersal events \cite{schlagel2020}.
Overall, our work provides a template for combining simple experimental methods with technological advances in tracking technology, and with a mechanistic approach to landscape ecology, in animal movement research.
