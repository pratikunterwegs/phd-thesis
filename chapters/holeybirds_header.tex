\section*{Abstract}

\small{
    The flight surfaces of bird wings require regular renewal through a process called molt --- shedding worn out feathers and growing fresh ones.
    Molt presents birds with the dilemma of needing more resources for feather growth just when their flight capacity is reduced due to feather loss, making them vulnerable to predation.
    We combined mechanistic and experimental approaches to present a first quantification of the direct effects of wing molt on the movement and habitat selection of four non-migratory passerine species. 
    We followed the movement of birds in different molt stages using a high-throughput tracking system. 
    Taking a viewshed ecology approach, we examined how birds used areas sheltered from observation by potential predators.
    We found that species' molt strategies determined whether they adjusted their movement to their wing condition. 
    Among species that adapted movement to molt status, natural molt led to increased movement between habitat patches, but artificial feather removal led to shorter between-patch movements. 
    Across molt status, birds preferred low-visibility areas that are sheltered from predators.
    Our work demonstrates how birds' fine-scale adaptive movement decisions are intertwined with their evolved physiological strategies, and that birds can adopt their predators' spatial perspectives at landscape scales, pre-emptively avoiding areas where they could be observed.
    Overall, we show how combining experimental and tracking approaches with mechanistic, biologically-grounded estimates of landscape attributes allows cross-species comparisons of movement strategies.
