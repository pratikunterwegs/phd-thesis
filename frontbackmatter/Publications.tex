\chaptermark{About the Author}

Pratik R. Gupte was born in India in 1993.
After schooling in Hyderabad and an undergraduate degree in zoology from St. Xavier's College, Mumbai in 2014, he worked on field projects in southern India, Ladakh, and in South Africa.
In 2017 he received a master's degree from the University of Kiel, as part of the International Master's in Applied Ecology, a programme spread over France, Portugal, Germany, and Ecuador.
His master's thesis on families of wintering Arctic geese saw fieldwork in the Russian Arctic and the Netherlands.
In 2018, he began his PhD in Franjo Weissing's lab at the University of Groningen.
Pratik is broadly intereste in the spatial ecology of animals, especially birds.
Recognising the unsustainability of the current model of academic science, he left the academic career track, and is now a research software engineer at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, where he develops epidemiological models to inform policy responses to disease outbreaks.
