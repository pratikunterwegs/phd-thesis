        \item \textit{Everybody believes your data but you, nobody believes your model but you.\\ --- John Fryxell, in coversation, 2021 (paraphrasing Einstein).}

        \item Animal movement ecology needs to adopt computational best-practices from other big-data disciplines.\\ --- \textit{Chapter \ref{ch:preprocessing}}.

        \item Animals' large-scale movement decisions incorporate not only what they can see, but what they think other individuals can see.\\ --- \textit{Chapter \ref{ch:holeybirds}}.

        \item Mechanistic, individual-based simulation modelling of movement decisions opens the door to insights into the evolutionary ecology of animal movement. \\ --- \textit{Chapters \ref{ch:kleptomove}, \ref{ch:pathomove}}.
        
        \item The emergence of individual variation in behavioural strategies is likely common in scenarios with spatial heterogeneity in costs and benefits.\\ --- \textit{Chapters \ref{ch:kleptomove}, \ref{ch:pathomove}}.

        \item Rapid evolution in social movement strategies under the risk of pathogen transmission can drastically reshape the structure of animal societies.\\ --- \textit{Chapter \ref{ch:pathomove}}.
        
        \item Statistical tools in movement ecology are sensitive to the scale and mechanisms of individual variation --- this makes understanding mechanisms as if not more important than applying sophisticated statistical methods.\\ --- \textit{Chapter \ref{ch:patternprocess}}.
        
        \item Ecologists are fated to be chroniclers of a dying earth.
        
        \item The mongoose is a non-goose.

        \item \textit{Coming back to where you started is not the same as never leaving.\\--- Terry Pratchet}
