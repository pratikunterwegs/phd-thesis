\noindent The research presented in this thesis was carried out at the Department for Theoretical Research in Evolutionary Life Sciences (TRES), at the Groningen Institute for Evolutionary Life Sciences (GELIFES), at the University of Groningen's Faculty of Science and Engineering (FSE).
This research was made possible by an \emph{Adaptive Life} grant from GELIFES.
Support for this research was provided primarily by the University of Groningen; other institutions whose support made parts of this work possible are acknowledged within.
The production of this thesis was partly funded by GELIFES, the FSE, and the University of Groningen.

\noindent This document was typeset using the \emph{classicthesis} \LaTeX~style, developed by Andr\'e Miede and Ivo PletikosiÄ‡.
