\noindent {\textsf{COLOPHON}}

\noindent \adftripleflourishright~~This document was typeset using the \emph{classicthesis} \LaTeX~style, developed by Andr\'e Miede and Ivo PletikosiÄ‡.
This style was inspired by Robert Bringhurst's seminal book on typography \emph{The Elements of Typographic Style}.
The text is mostly set in \emph{IBM Plex Serif}, a typeface created by Mike Abbink and the Hague-based type foundry \emph{Blue Monday}.
% Vernon Adams' \textsf{Oswald} is used for headings, as it pairs well with \textit{Source Serif} and serves especially well on the cover.
The cover design is inspired by the colours of the Japanese edition of Theodore M. Porter's ``\emph{Trust the Numbers}''.
