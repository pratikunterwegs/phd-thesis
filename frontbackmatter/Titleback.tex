\noindent {\textsf{COLOPHON}}

This document was typeset based on \emph{classicthesis}, developed by Andr\'e Miede and Ivo Pletikosić.
The style was inspired by Robert Bringhurst's seminal book on typography ``\emph{The Elements of Typographic Style}''.
Inspired by Wouter Vahl's PhD thesis ``\emph{Interference Competition in Foraging Waders}'', Matthew Carter's Charter is used for the main text; Vernon Adams' Oswald is used for headings.
The cover design is inspired by the colours of the Japanese edition of Theodore M. Porter's ``\emph{Trust the Numbers}''.
