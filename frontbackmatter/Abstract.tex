% Competition typically takes place in a spatial context, but eco-evolutionary models rarely address the joint evolution of movement and competition strategies. 
% Here we investigate a spatially explicit forager-kleptoparasite model where consumers can either forage on a heterogeneous resource landscape, or steal resource items from conspecifics (kleptoparasitism). 
% We consider three scenarios: (1) foragers without kleptoparasites; (2) consumers specializing as foragers or as kleptoparasites; and (3) consumers that can switch between foraging and kleptoparasitism depending on local conditions.
% We model movement strategies as individual-specific combinations of preferences for environmental cues, similar to step-selection coefficients.
% By means of mechanistic, individual-based simulations, we study the joint evolution of movement and competition strategies, and we investigate the implications on the resource landscape and the distribution of consumers over this landscape.
% Movement and competition strategies evolve rapidly and consistently across all scenarios, with marked differences among scenarios, leading to differences in resource exploitation patterns.
% % The evolved movement and resource exploitation patterns differ considerably across the three scenarios.
% In scenario 1, foragers evolve considerable individual variation in movement strategies, while in scenario 2, movement strategy is tightly correlated with competition strategy, with a swift divergence between foragers and kleptoparasites.
% When individuals' competition strategy is conditional on local cues, movement strategies converge to facilitate kleptoparasitism, and individual consistency in competition strategy also emerges.
% Across scenarios, the distribution of consumers over resources differs substantially from `ideal free' predictions. 
% This is related to the intrinsic difficulty of moving effectively on a depleted resource landscape with few reliable cues for movement.
% Our study emphasises the advantages of a mechanistic approach when studying competition in a spatial context, and suggests how evolutionary modelling can be integrated with current work in animal movement ecology.
