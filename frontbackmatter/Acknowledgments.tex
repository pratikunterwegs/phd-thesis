\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

It's almost never a good idea to look back on an experience too soon, nor to try to gauge whether it was good or bad.
I think my PhD was defined by upheaval, and if not conflict, then friction.

I'd especially like to thank Rebecca Rimbach, with whom I've worked on and off since 2014, when we first met in Goegap, South Africa, where she was my supervisor.
Rebecca recommended me for both my master's and PhD, and it was after tracking radio-tagged mice with a hand-held GPS device, that I became more interested in working with movement loggers and data.

I had the good fortune to have worked with two very ambitious and driven people --- these are qualities I prize above many others --- I look forward to working with them in the years to come.
Both have 

Special thanks are due to Vijay Ramesh, with whom I've worked, entirely remotely, since 2019.
After interacting over some R related issues on Twitter, Vijay asked me to join him as the main programmer for a 6-month project that's been running for 3.5 years now.
I used this project as a testbed for new techniques, ideas, and methods that I was interested in and didn't have any other venue to try.

I also want to thank Greg Albery, among my most recent collaborators, and someone whose work I've held in high regard for a while.
It was among my highlights of 2021 when Greg tried to recruit me to his supervisor's lab --- it was a great boost to my confidence at a difficult time.
Meeting in person at a conference in December 2021 helped me to see the value of my own work, with which he is now involved.

Thanks also to all my other collaborators: Orr Spiegel, Sivan Toledo, Yosef Kiat, Yoav Barton, and Amy Sweeny.

\medskip

Most of all I want to thank Josh Lambert.
In three short years, Josh has managed to change me more than anybody else.
I would never have tried a number of things I now enjoy without Josh suggesting them, and often, accompanying me: squash, long-distance cycling, programming in Julia, or baking cakes.
I also accepted a more serious change that had been unthinkable until Josh convinced me that I could successfully see it through: that I would eventually leave academia.
Josh is very smart and grounded, and he's the first person I go to for advice.
