  abstract = {Movement is a fundamental aspect of life and tracking wild animals under natural conditions has become central to animal behaviour, ecology, and conservation science. Data from tracked animals have provided novel scientific insights on extreme migratory journeys, mechanisms of navigation, space use, and early warning signals of environmental change. Studying movement is therefore important, particularly in systems that may be vulnerable to anthropogenic effects. Technological advancements, and chiefly the development of GPS tags, have enabled animal tracking at high spatiotemporal resolution, yet trade-offs between cost, sampling frequency, tag weight and data retrieval limit the use of GPS tags to relatively few individuals and large species. A new ‘reverse-GPS’ wildlife tracking system, ATLAS, employs an array of receiver stations that detect and localise small (∼0.6 g without battery), low-cost (∼25 euro) tags by calculating differences in the arrival time of tag signal at minimally three stations. In this study, we introduce the Wadden Sea ATLAS system (WATLAS), implemented in the Dutch Wadden Sea, the Netherland’s only natural UNESCO World Heritage Site, yet affected by a suite of anthropogenic activities, such as commercial fishing, mining, shipping, as well as sea level rise. From July 2017 to July 2021, we tracked 821 red knots, 182 sanderlings, 33 bar-tailed godwits, and 6 common terns. With four examples, we illustrate how WATLAS opens-up possibilities for studying space-use, among-individual variation in movement, and intra-specific interactions, and inter-specific (community) space use in the wild. We additionally argue that WATLAS could provide a tool for impact assessment, and thus aid nature conservation and management of the globally important Wadden Sea ecosystem.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.}

  abstract = {Movement strategies of animals have been well studied as a function of ecological drivers (e.g., forage selection and avoiding predation) rather than physiological requirements (e.g., thermoregulation). Thermal stress is a major concern for large mammals, especially for savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana), which have amongst the greatest challenge for heat dissipation in hot and arid environments. Therefore, elephants must make decisions about where and how fast to move to reduce thermal stress. We tracked 14 herds of elephant in Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa, for 2 years, using GPS collars with inbuilt temperature sensors to examine the influence of temperature on movement strategies, particularly when accessing water. We first confirmed that collar-mounted temperature loggers captured hourly variation in relative ambient temperatures across the landscape, and thus, could be used to predict elephant movement strategies at fine spatio-temporal scales. We found that elephants moved slower in more densely wooded areas, but unexpectedly, moved faster at higher temperatures, especially in the wet season compared to the dry season. Notably, this speed of movement was highest when elephants were approaching and leaving water sources. Visits to water showed a periodic shuttling pattern, with a peak return rate of 10-30 hours, wherein elephants were closest to water during the hotter times of the day, and spent longer at water sources in the dry season compared to the wet season. When elephants left water, they showed low fidelity to the same water source, and travelled farther in the dry season than in the wet season. In KNP, where water is easily accessible, and the risk of poaching is low, we found that elephants use short, high-speed bursts of movement to get to water at hotter times of day. This strategy not only provides the benefit of predation risk avoidance, but also allows them to use water to thermoregulate. We demonstrate that ambient temperature is an important predictor of movement and water use across the landscape, with elephants responding facultatively to a “landscape of thermal stress”.},
