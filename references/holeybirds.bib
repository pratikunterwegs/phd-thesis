  abstract = {There has been rapid increase of interest in the role that information acquisition plays in ecological process and in shaping life histories and their evolution. Compared to auditory and olfactory cues, the range at which visual cues are likely to be informative to animals is particularly sensitive to the spatial structure of the environment. However, quantification of and accounting for availability of visual information in fundamental and applied ecological research remains extremely limited. We argue that a comprehensive understanding of animal behaviour in a spatial context would greatly benefit from objective quantification of the area an animal can potentially obtain visual information from and therefore draw broad attention to viewshed analysis. This analysis identifies all cells of a gridded surface that are connected by lines-of-sight to a viewpoint, hence, providing information on how much of the environment surrounding a location can be seen. Although heavily used in non-ecological disciplines including civil planning and archaeology, viewshed analysis has seldom been applied in an ecological context. Here, we highlight the opportunity to make use of viewshed approaches in conjunction with three-dimensional remote sensing data and data from animal tracking to make major progress in understanding how visual information influences animal spatial behaviour, ecology and evolution.},

  abstract = {Animal spatial behaviour is often presumed to reflect responses to visual cues. However, inference of behaviour in relation to the environment is challenged by the lack of objective methods to identify the information that effectively is available to an animal from a given location. In general, animals are assumed to have unconstrained information on the environment within a detection circle of a certain radius (the perceptual range; PR). However, visual cues are only available up to the first physical obstruction within an animal's PR, making information availability a function of an animal's location within the physical environment (the effective visual perceptual range; EVPR). By using LiDAR data and viewshed analysis, we modelled forest birds' EVPRs at each step along a movement path. We found that the EVPR was on average 0.063\% that of an unconstrained PR and, by applying a step-selection analysis, that individuals are 1.55 times more likely to move to a tree within their EVPR than to an equivalent tree outside it. This demonstrates that behavioural choices can be substantially impacted by the characteristics of an individual's EVPR and highlights that inferences made from movement data may be improved by accounting for the EVPR.},

  abstract = {A resource selection function is a model of the likelihood that an available spatial unit will be used by an animal, given its resource value. But how do we appropriately define availability? Step selection analysis deals with this problem at the scale of the observed positional data, by matching each `used step' (connecting two consecutive observed positions of the animal) with a set of `available steps' randomly sampled from a distribution of observed steps or their characteristics. Here we present a simple extension to this approach, termed integrated step selection analysis (iSSA), which relaxes the implicit assumption that observed movement attributes (i.e. velocities and their temporal autocorrelations) are independent of resource selection. Instead, iSSA relies on simultaneously estimating movement and resource selection parameters, thus allowing simple likelihood-based inference of resource selection within a mechanistic movement model. We provide theoretical underpinning of iSSA, as well as practical guidelines to its implementation. Using computer simulations, we evaluate the inferential and predictive capacity of iSSA compared to currently used methods. Our work demonstrates the utility of iSSA as a general, flexible and user-friendly approach for both evaluating a variety of ecological hypotheses, and predicting future ecological patterns.},

  abstract = {Animals may update their assessment of predation risk according to how a potential predator approaches them. For example, the predator's head and gaze orientation (direction of attention) may reveal its intentions, and faster-approaching predators are likely to represent greater risk. We examined the reactions of hadeda ibises Bostrychia hagedash. These large birds demonstrate a wide repertoire of responses to being approached (e.g. continuing to forage, slow walking, rapid escape walking, flight and alarm calling). Birds were approached tangentially 112 times by a human who either had the head and eyes directed towards (65 approaches) or directed away from (47 approaches) the birds to test the hypothesis that the direction of the observer's attention informs alert distance (AD) and flight initiation distance (FID) in these birds. Direction of attention had a significant effect on AD and FID as well as the likelihood of taking flight and alarm calling by hadedas, with birds appearing to associate attention directed towards them as an indication of increased risk. Hadedas were able to differentiate between the direction of attention of an approaching human, whether or not there were multiple other humans in the near vicinity. We also examined whether the observer's approach speed altered the birds' responses. Approach speed affected the birds' FID, suggesting that they perceive greater danger in a faster-approaching intruder compared with a slower-walking one. These results support the predictions of optimal escape theory and emphasize the high resolution of anti-predatory awareness in these birds. The marked success of hadeda ibises in urban environments may be due to their ability to become habituated to human presence and to modify their antipredator behaviour in response to subtle cues. These may be common traits of bird species that successfully adapt to urban environments.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Fine-scale tracking of animal movement is important to understand the proximate mechanisms of animal behaviour. While GPS tracking is an excellent tool for measuring animal movement, it often causes a trade-off between tag weight, cost and lifespan that limits its application to relatively large individuals, a small number of individuals or short tracking durations, respectively. The reverse-GPS system, ATLAS, uses lighter, cheaper tags that last long periods of time at the similar sampling frequencies to GPS. ATLAS provides a regional-scale alternative to global GPS-based tracking with which hundreds of relatively small-bodied species can be tracked simultaneously for long periods of time. Here, we test the accuracy and precision of an ATLAS system, using concurrent GPS measurements as a reference. To measure accuracy, we calculated the distance between ATLAS and GPS location estimates for a route (mobile test) and 16 fixed locations (stationary test) on the Griend mudflat, the Netherlands. This location is the focus of a large-scale ATLAS system in the Wadden Sea consisting of 26 receivers and covering 1326 km2 of intertidal region, with almost no physical obstacles for radio signals. ATLAS-derived location estimates differed on average 4.2 m from GPS-estimated stationary test sites and 5.7 m from GPS tracks taken whilst moving between them. Signals that were collected by more receiver stations were more accurate, although even 3-receiver localisations were comparable with GPS localisations (\textasciitilde 10 m difference). Higher receiver stations detected the tag at further distances. In conclusion, ATLAS provides an alternative to GPS for regional-scale animal movement studies by providing movement data of comparable spatial accuracy. The growing use of the ATLAS systems motivates further refinement of best-practice application, such as considering the height of receivers, their spatial arrangement, density and the movement mode of the study species (e.g., ground-dwelling or flying). {$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {We introduce a new method, Residual Raggedness Value (RRV), for estimating molt duration for individual birds captured only once during a molting period. The method is developed and tested using data from Willow Warblers (Phylloscopus trochilus) in prebasic (post-nuptial) molt collected in Swedish Lapland during 1983-1990. The wing raggedness value (RV) describes the amount of "missing" feather area in the wing of a molting bird. RV was positively correlated with stage of molt. The RRVs from this correlation were used to obtain an estimate of the size of the gap in the wing that was independent of stage of molt (i.e., RV controlled for stage of molt). Molt speed of recaptured birds was highly correlated with RRV at the first capture (r2=0.57). Thus, an individual's future molt speed could be predicted at the first capture with a high degree of accuracy. Compared to other methods for estimating molt duration, the RRV method produced estimates close to those obtained from recaptured birds. The widely used regression method for estimating molt duration (regressing date of capture on molt score) gave estimates that deviated substantially from both those obtained from the recapture and RRV methods. Our new method is a potentially powerful tool for increasing sample sizes of individual molt speeds in a studied population. This will facilitate understanding how individual birds may adjust the timing and duration of molt in relation to breeding and migration. The RRV method is probably applicable to most species that molt feathers sequentially. However, slow-molting species with few simultaneously growing feathers might be problematic.},

  abstract = {Movement ecology has developed rapidly over the past decade, driven by advances in tracking technology that have largely removed data limitations. Development of rigorous analytical tools has lagged behind empirical progress, and as a result, relocation data sets have been underutilized. Discrete-time correlated random walk models (CRW) have long served as the foundation for analyzing relocation data. Unfortunately, CRWs confound the sampling and movement processes. CRW parameter estimates thus depend sensitively on the sampling schedule, which makes it difficult to draw sampling-independent inferences about the underlying movement process. Furthermore, CRWs cannot accommodate the multiscale autocorrelations that typify modern, finely sampled relocation data sets. Recent developments in modelling movement as a continuous-time stochastic process (CTSP) solve these problems, but the mathematical difficulty of using CTSPs has limited their adoption in ecology. To remove this roadblock, we introduce the ctmm package for the R statistical computing environment. ctmm implements all of the CTSPs currently in use in the ecological literature and couples them with powerful statistical methods for autocorrelated data adapted from geostatistics and signal processing, including variograms, periodograms and non-Markovian maximum likelihood estimation. ctmm is built around a standard workflow that begins with visual diagnostics, proceeds to candidate model identification, and then to maximum likelihood fitting and AIC-based model selection. Once an accurate CTSP for the data has been fitted and selected, analyses that require such a model, such as quantifying home range areas via autocorrelated kernel density estimation or estimating occurrence distributions via time-series Kriging, can then be performed. We use a case study with African buffalo to demonstrate the capabilities of ctmm and highlight the steps of a typical CTSP movement analysis workflow.},

Prey responses to conspicuous indicators of risk (such as looming predators or fleeing conspecifics) are well documented, but there should also be strong selection for the detection of more subtle cues. A predator's head orientation and eye-gaze direction are good candidates for subtle but useful indicators of risk, since many predators orient their head and eyes towards their prey as they attack. We describe the first explicit demonstration of a bird responding to a live predator's eye-gaze direction. We present wild-caught European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) with human `predators' whose frontal appearance and gaze direction are manipulated independently, and show that starlings are sensitive to the predator's orientation, the presence of eyes and the direction of eye-gaze. Starlings respond in a functionally significant manner: when the predator's gaze was averted, starlings resumed feeding earlier, at a higher rate and consumed more food overall. By correctly assessing lower risk and returning to feeding activity earlier (as in this study), the animal gains a competitive advantage over conspecifics that do not respond to the subtle predator cue in this way.},

  abstract = {How does a hovering hummingbird compensate for the loss of flight feathers during moult when the mechanism of lift force generation by flapping wings is impaired? The flight performance of five individual ruby-throated hummingbirds with moulting primary flight feathers and reduced wing area was compared with that before their moult. Hummingbirds were flown in reduced air densities using normoxic heliox so that a range of flight energetics was displayed. The rate of moulting and the extent of wing area loss varied among individuals. One female could tolerate a 30\% loss of wing area in moulting and flew with only three outer primaries per wing. Further exploratory study using the artificial reduction of wing area, either by cutting the tips of the outer primaries of a male or by plucking the secondaries of two females, suggested that secondaries play a minor role in lift force generation during hovering whereas the tip area of primaries is crucial. For the five birds, ranges of whole-bird oxygen consumption rates, wingbeat kinematics (stroke amplitude) and lift coefficients did not vary during the moult. This constancy was mainly achieved through weight loss that alleviated aerodynamic force requirements for weight support during hovering. Since the metabolic power expenditure during moult was similar to that of normal birds but the mechanical power requirement was reduced, the flight efficiency also showed a sharp reduction during moult. This increased cost of flight may result from disruption of the integrity of the flight machinery. Overall, the control of body mass in hummingbirds can provide similar aerodynamic, muscle mechanical and physiological capacities under conditions of variable flight demand.},

In all experiments, participants saw a picture of two objects and asked to judge the relationship between the objects when there was, or was not, an agent between them. Results from Experiment 1 showed that participants spontaneously described the objects from the agent's perspective when he was present. Experiments 2 and 3 explored whether this effect was altered by prior participant exposure to manipulations of social inclusion or social exclusion. Results from these two studies demonstrated that socially included participants and socially excluded participants did not differ in their tendencies to adopt the spatial perspective of another. These results are discussed in the context of the results of other studies showing that perspective taking can be influenced by social motivations.},

  abstract = {The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 outbreak at Qinghai Lake, China, in 2005 caused the death of over 6,000 migratory birds, half of which were Bar-headed Geese Anser indicus. Understanding the movements of this species may inform monitoring of outbreak risks for HPAI viruses; thus, we investigated the movement patterns of 29 Bar-headed Geese at Qinghai Lake, China during 2007 and 2008 by using high resolution GPS satellite telemetry. We described the movements and distribution of marked Bar-headed Geese during the pre-nesting, nesting, and moulting periods. Of 21 Bar-headed Geese with complete transmission records, 3 moved to other areas during the nesting period: 2 to Jianghe wetland (50~km northwest of Qinghai Lake) and 1 to Cuolongka Lake (220~km northwest of Qinghai Lake) during the nesting period. We identified nesting attempts of 7 of the marked geese at Qinghai Lake. Four completed successful nesting attempts according to our rules of judgment for the breeding status, and 2 geese lost broods soon after hatching (hereafter referred to as unsuccessful breeders). Of 18 geese present at Qinghai Lake during the nesting period, 9 (6 non-breeders, 2 successful breeders and 1 unsuccessful breeder) remained at Qinghai Lake during the moulting period; and 9 (5 non-breeders, 4 unsuccessful breeders) left Qinghai Lake for moulting. Kuhai Lake, Donggeicuona Lake, Alake Lake, Zhaling-Eling Lake area and Huangheyuan wetland area were used as moulting sites. Geese that moulted at Qinghai Lake, Cuolongka Lake, Kuhai Lake, Donggeicuona Lake and Alake Lake also moved to Zhaling-Eling Lake area or Huangheyuan wetland area and stayed there for several days prior to autumn migration. Mean home range and core area estimates did not differ significantly by sex, year and between breeders and non-breeders.},

  abstract = {Attending to where others are looking is thought to be of great adaptive benefit for animals when avoiding predators and interacting with group members. Many animals have been reported to respond to the gaze of others, by co-orienting their gaze with group members (gaze following) and/or responding fearfully to the gaze of predators or competitors (i.e., gaze aversion). Much of the literature has focused on the cognitive underpinnings of gaze sensitivity, namely whether animals have an understanding of the attention and visual perspectives in others. Yet there remain several unanswered questions regarding how animals learn to follow or avoid gaze and how experience may influence their behavioral responses. Many studies on the ontogeny of gaze sensitivity have shed light on how and when gaze abilities emerge and change across development, indicating the necessity to explore gaze sensitivity when animals are exposed to additional information from their environment as adults. Gaze aversion may be dependent upon experience and proximity to different predator types, other cues of predation risk, and the salience of gaze cues. Gaze following in the context of information transfer within social groups may also be dependent upon experience with group-members; therefore we propose novel means to explore the degree to which animals respond to gaze in a flexible manner, namely by inhibiting or enhancing gaze following responses. We hope this review will stimulate gaze sensitivity research to expand beyond the narrow scope of investigating underlying cognitive mechanisms, and to explore how gaze cues may function to communicate information other than attention.},

  abstract = {Life-history theory proposes that costs must be associated with reproduction. Many direct costs are incurred during breeding. There is also evidence for indirect costs, incurred after breeding, which decrease survival and future reproductive success. One possible indirect cost identified in birds is that breeding activity in some way compromises plumage quality in the subsequent moult. Here we propose a mechanism by which this could occur. Breeding activity delays the start of moult. Birds that start to moult later also moult more rapidly - an effect of decreasing daylength. Could this result in poorer quality plumage? We kept two groups of male European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, one on constant long days and the other on decreasing daylengths from the start of moult. Decreasing daylengths reduced the duration of moult from 103 {$\pm$} 4 days to 73 {$\pm$} 3 days (p {$<$} 0.0001). Newly grown primary feathers of birds that moulted fast were slightly shorter, weighed less (p {$<$} 0.05) and were more asymmetrical. They had a thinner rachis (p {$<$} 0.005), were less hard (p {$<$} 0.01) and less rigid (p {$<$} 0.05). They were also less resistant to wear so that differences in mass and asymmetry increased with time. There was no difference in Young's modulus. Poorer quality plumage will lead to decreased survival due to decreased flight performance and increased thermoregulatory costs. Thus, reproduction incurs costs through a mechanism that operates after the end of breeding.},

Extending this technique to global scales raises several issues: identifying land cover types that are spectrally distinct and applicable at the global scale; accounting for phasing of seasons in different parts of the world; validating results in the absence of reliable information on global land cover; and acquiring high quality global data sets of satellite sensor data for input to land cover classifications. For this study, a coarse spatial resolution (one by one degree) data set of monthly NDVI values for 1987 was used to explore these methodological issues. A result of a supervised, maximum likelihood classification of eleven cover types is presented to illustrate the feasibility of using satellite sensor data to increase the accuracy of global land cover information, although the result has not been validated systematically. Satellite sensor data at finer spatial resolutions that include other bands in addition to NDVI, as well as methodologies to better identify and describe gradients between cover types, could increase the accuracy of results of global land cover data sets derived from satellite sensor data.},

This review discusses the evolutionary role of social gaze in vertebrates (focusing on primates), and a hypothesis that this role has changed substantially for primates compared to other animals. This change may have been driven by morphological changes to the face and eyes of primates, limitations in the facial anatomy of other vertebrates, changes in the ecology of the environment in which primates live, and a necessity to communicate information about the environment, emotional and mental states. The eyes represent different levels of signal value depending on the status, disposition and emotional state of the sender and receiver of such signals. There are regions in the monkey and human brain which contain neurons that respond selectively to faces, bodies and eye gaze. The ability to follow another individual's gaze direction is affected in individuals with autism and other psychopathological disorders, and after particular localized brain lesions. The hypothesis that gaze following is ``hard-wired'' in the brain, and may be localized within a circuit linking the superior temporal sulcus, amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex is discussed.},

Sophisticated analyses that explicitly model correlation rather than consider it a nuisance, like mixed effects and state-space models, offer potentially novel insights into the process of resource selection, but additional work is needed to make them more generally applicable to large datasets based on the use\textendash availability designs.

Despite their popularity, many users struggle with interpreting parameters in habitat-selection and step-selection functions. Integrated step-selection analyses also require several additional steps to translate model parameters into a full-fledged movement model, and the mathematics supporting this approach can be challenging for many to understand. Using simple examples, we demonstrate how weighted distribution theory and the inhomogeneous Poisson point process can facilitate parameter interpretation in habitat-selection analyses. Furthermore, we provide a `how to' guide illustrating the steps required to implement integrated step-selection analyses using the amt package By providing clear examples with open-source code, we hope to make habitat-selection analyses more understandable and accessible to end users.},

Relocation data often represent a complex mixture of different movement behaviors, and reliably decomposing this mix into its component parts is an unresolved problem in movement ecology. Traditional approaches, such as composite random walk models, require that the timescales characterizing the movement are all similar to the usually arbitrary data-sampling rate. Movement behaviors such as long-distance searching and fine-scale foraging, however, are often intermixed but operate on vastly different spatial and temporal scales. An approach that integrates the full sweep of movement behaviors across scales is currently lacking. Here we show how the semivariance function (SVF) of a stochastic movement process can both identify multiple movement modes and solve the sampling rate problem. We express a broad range of continuous-space, continuous-time stochastic movement models in terms of their SVFs, connect them to relocation data via variogram regression, and compare them using standard model selection techniques. We illustrate our approach using Mongolian gazelle relocation data and show that gazelle movement is characterized by ballistic foraging movements on a 6-h timescale, fast diffusive searching with a 10-week timescale, and asymptotic diffusion over longer timescales.},

Kernel density estimation (KDE) is a workhorse technique for range delineation problems that is both statistically efficient and nonparametric. KDE assumes that the data are independent and identically distributed (IID). However, animal tracking data, which are routinely used as inputs to KDEs, are inherently autocorrelated and violate this key assumption. As we demonstrate, using realistically autocorrelated data in conventional KDEs results in grossly underestimated home ranges. We further show that the performance of conventional KDEs actually degrades as data quality improves, because autocorrelation strength increases as movement paths become more finely resolved. To remedy these flaws with the traditional KDE method, we derive an autocorrelated KDE (AKDE) from first principles to use autocorrelated data, making it perfectly suited for movement data sets. We illustrate the vastly improved performance of AKDE using analytical arguments, relocation data from Mongolian gazelles, and simulations based upon the gazelle's observed movement process. By yielding better minimum area estimates for threatened wildlife populations, we believe that future widespread use of AKDE will have significant impact on ecology and conservation biology.},

Geese showed slowest step rates and highest peck rates in vegetation types rich in Puccinellia. Examination of faecal material confirmed that the geese fed almost exclusively on PuccineEia during the main moult period, despite its limited spatial distribution. Puccinellia maritima exhibited the highest levels of protein of any of the graminoid species present except for the belowground lower stem base of Sea Club-rush Scirpus maritimus, which offers a nongrowing food resource which is difficult to extract and consume. The results of this study suggest that the statement that the ``limited data available for moulting waterfowl indicate no active selection for proteinaceous foods; i.e., birds are selecting foods in proportion to their availability'' does not hold for Greylag Geese moulting on Saltholm.},

  abstract = {The annual migration cycle of waterbirds often involves several distinct movement stages, for example within-winter movements or the moult migration during summer, which require a high degree of individual flexibility in migration direction. Here, we investigate whether such flexibility is a common characteristic of waterbird migration by analysing movement behaviour of a dabbling duck, the gadwall Anas strepera, during the little studied, intermediate autumn period. The tracking of individuals via satellite transmitters (n = 7) as well as the ring re-encounter analysis of three European gadwall populations (Germany, England, Russia) revealed that autumn movements were multidirectional. Furthermore, the comparison with winter re-encounters suggested that autumn movements were partly independent of the movements towards subsequently used south to southwestern wintering areas. Some individuals even travelled long distances north- or eastwards. Accordingly, some autumn locations were characterized by a harsh climate, thus serving as temporary staging sites but necessitating further movements when wetlands freeze during winter. The occurrence of such detours or reversals of migration was confirmed by the transmitter data. Inter-individual variability in distance and direction of autumn movements was found for both sexes and age-classes indicating that gadwalls, in general, followed flexible movement strategies. Based on the extent of multidirectional autumn movements, we hypothesize important benefits of such flights and suggest that the analysis of year-round movement patterns of individual animals during their distinct life-history stages is essential to understand how they can successfully reproduce and survive.},

  abstract = {Predation is a fundamental ecological process, but there are few studies of predation risk for adult, breeding birds. In this study, we quantified Relative Predation Risk (RPR) for 46 species of passerine birds preyed on by sparrowhawks during the breeding season in south-western Sweden. The sparrowhawk is a major predator of smaller birds in Eurasian forests and woodland. Near nesting hawk pairs, prey abundance was estimated by line transects. From prey remains at hawk nests, we estimated the frequency of prey species in the diet of hawks. For each hawk pair, RPR values for different prey species were calculated. The mean RPR for each prey species, based on hawk pairs as sample units, indicated degree of overrepresentation (positive RPR) or underrepresentation (negative RPR) of the prey in the diet. Prey species with a high positive RPR nested mainly near human habitations (villages or towns), at forest edges and in farmland. However, there were marked seasonal changes in RPR. Forest birds, such as the goldcrest and wren, had the highest RPR in April. Later, the hawks seemed to hunt mainly in the habitats mentioned above, where prey were more abundant or easier to catch, resulting in increasing RPR for the house sparrow, yellowhammer, greenfinch and other species. RPR values were analysed in relation to prey body size (mass) and relative density, as well as prey foraging height and nest height (categorized from the literature). In addition, the mean perch height and mean exposure of prey species were quantified in the field. Most predation was due to the smaller male hawks, providing food for their mates and young, RPR increased with prey body size up to a mass of about 40 g, then declined with increasing body size (larger prey being more difficult to catch), RPR decreased with increasing relative density of prey species. Nest height was not correlated with RPR, but foraging height seems to be an important factor: RPR decreased with increasing foraging height. A similar result was found for mean perch height, when larger prey (over 40 g) and singing individuals were excluded from the field data. RPR increased with mean exposure of prey species when larger prey and singing birds were excluded; a combination of perch height and exposure improved the correlation with RPR. Singing birds were generally perched high in the vegetation and may not suffer high predation risk, contrary to common belief. The results of this study are discussed in relation to temporal and geographical variation in RPR and antipredator adaptations in passerine birds.}

We experimentally accelerated the moult speed of a group of blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) by exposing them to a rapidly decreasing photoperiod and compared the spectral characteristics of their structural feather colours with those of control birds. Blue tits were sexually dimorphic on the UV/blue crown and on the white cheek feathers. Moult speed, however, dramatically reduced brightness and the saturation only on the UV/blue crown feathers, whereas structural white on the cheek feathers was basically unaffected by moult speed. Given that the time available for moulting is usually confined to the period between the end of the breeding season and migration or wintering, UV/blue colours, but not structural white, may convey long-term information about an individual's performance during the previous breeding season. The trade-off between fast moulting and structural colour expression may represent a previously unrecognized selective advantage for early-breeding birds.},

  abstract = {Modern, high-throughput animal tracking increasingly yields `big data' at very fine temporal scales. At these scales, location error can exceed the animal's step size, leading to mis-estimation of behaviours inferred from movement. `Cleaning' the data to reduce location errors is one of the main ways to deal with position uncertainty. Although data cleaning is widely recommended, inclusive, uniform guidance on this crucial step, and on how to organise the cleaning of massive datasets, is relatively scarce. A pipeline for cleaning massive high-throughput datasets must balance ease of use and computationally efficiency, in which location errors are rejected while preserving valid animal movements. Another useful feature of a pre-processing pipeline is efficiently segmenting and clustering location data for statistical methods while also being scalable to large datasets and robust to imperfect sampling. Manual methods being prohibitively time-consuming, and to boost reproducibility, pre-processing pipelines must be automated. We provide guidance on building pipelines for pre-processing high-throughput animal tracking data to prepare it for subsequent analyses. We apply our proposed pipeline to simulated movement data with location errors, and also show how large volumes of cleaned data can be transformed into biologically meaningful `residence patches', for exploratory inference on animal space use. We use tracking data from the Wadden Sea ATLAS system (WATLAS) to show how pre-processing improves its quality, and to verify the usefulness of the residence patch method. Finally, with tracks from Egyptian fruit bats Rousettus aegyptiacus, we demonstrate the pre-processing pipeline and residence patch method in a fully worked out example. To help with fast implementation of standardised methods, we developed the R package atlastools, which we also introduce here. Our pre-processing pipeline and atlastools can be used with any high-throughput animal movement data in which the high data-volume combined with knowledge of the tracked individuals' movement capacity can be used to reduce location errors. atlastools is easy to use for beginners while providing a template for further development. The common use of simple yet robust pre-processing steps promotes standardised methods in the field of movement ecology and leads to better inferences from data.},

To deal with this the birds could for example suspend moult or moult faster. In this paper we investigate the effect of an induced time-constraint on the moult of Lesser Whitethroats Sylvia curruca. The time-constraint was induced through a shift in light regime large enough to transfer the birds to a date when, under normal conditions, they already should have started moulting. Time-constrained birds moulted faster and also grew shorter wing feathers, resulting in a shorter wing, compared to control birds. Only one individual responded by interrupting moult and retained a number of inner primaries unmoulted. The observed adjustments of moult, and the higher fuel loads towards the end of moult, are consistent with the ideas that time is an important factor in bird migration, affecting not only migration but also the events preceding it.},

Since many predators control their attacks with vision it is of interest to determine whether prey animals are responsive to information that specifies the orientation of other animals' visual systems. To determine whether wild-caught sparrows are sensitive to the looking behavior of other animals, they were exposed to the experimenter's head held at various orientations relative to the birds. Aspects of the experimenter's visage, as well as that of an artificial face, were manipulated in order to identify the features of the human face relevant to the perception of line of gaze. Sparrows responded most strongly while the face of the experimenter was oriented toward them, but were indifferent to the direction in which the eyes gazed. Tests using a model human face showed that sparrows are responsive to changes in the number of visible eyes, but not to changes in the symmetry of the nose between the eyes.}

We investigated the aerodynamic effects of having moult gaps in a rectangular wing by using a vortex-lattice (panel) approach, and we modelled the effect of moult gap size at the wing moult initiation position, of gap position in the primary tract and of two simultaneous gaps (as occurs during secondary feather moulting in many birds). Both gap size and gap position had a detrimental effect on aerodynamic performance as measured by lift curve slope, effective aspect ratio and the aerodynamic efficiency of the wing. The effect was largest when the moult gap was well inside the wing, because the circulation declines close to the wing tip. In fact, when the gap was at the wing tip, the performance was slightly increased because the lift distribution then became closer to the optimal elliptical distribution. The detrimental effect of moult gaps increased with increasing aspect ratio, which could help to explain why large birds have relatively slow rates of moult associated with small gaps.},

Bird data were collected through the use of belt transects and supplemented by walking and listening outside transects.

The probability of occurrence for all six common species (Grasshopper Sparrows, Bobolinks, Upland Sandpipers, Western Meadowlarks, Dickcissels, and Red-winged Blackbirds) was significantly inversely correlated with perimeter\textendash area ratio.

Gliding airspeed did not scale with bird size and wing morphology, and unexpectedly converged to a narrow range. To explain this discrepancy, we propose that soaring-gliding birds adjust their gliding airspeed according to the risk of grounding or switching to costly flapping flight. Introducing the Risk Aversion Flight Index (RAFI, the ratio of actual to theoretical risk-averse gliding airspeed), we found that inter- and intraspecific variation in RAFI positively correlated with wing loading, and negatively correlated with convective thermal conditions and gliding altitude, respectively. We propose that risk-sensitive behaviour modulates the evolution (morphology) and ecology (response to environmental conditions) of bird soaring flight.},

Moult and migration involve different physiological processes (replacement of body proteins vs energy storage for endurance flights). This study investigates metabolic responses to three phases of the annual cycle (postbreeding, moulting and migratory periods) in three physiological situations (feeding during the day, overnight fasted, short-term fasted) by examining six plasma metabolite levels of three bird species. 2. In birds feeding during the day, diurnal body mass gain, triglyceride and free fatty-acid plasma levels were higher during the migratory period than during the postbreeding and moulting periods. This reflects hyperphagia and hyperlipogenesis in preparation for migratory flights. 3. No clear effects of moult were found on the metabolite levels examined. 4. Overnight fasting was generally characterized by low protein catabolism (low uric acid levels) and increased fat utilization (high free fatty-acid, glycerol and {$\beta$}-hydroxybutyrate levels), compared with feeding birds. 5. During the migratory period, however, overnight fasted birds showed no elevated free fatty-acid levels, a more marked drop in triglyceride levels, unchanged glucose levels, less increased {$\beta$}-hydroxy-butyrate levels and a stronger decrease in uric acid levels than birds in the postbreeding and moulting periods. This suggests that the increased fat deposition rate during the migratory period leads to increased hepatic and muscular lipid stores by the end of the day. During the migratory period, a higher utilization of these triglycerides allows a lower utilization of fatty acids from adipose tissues and a more effective sparing of protein and carbohydrates during overnight fasting than during the postbreeding period. 6. These metabolic responses were more pronounced in the Blackcap and Robin than in the Garden Warbler which starts migration when it is in the last stages of moult.]}

  abstract = {During the periodic moult of the plumage of birds, a fast regrowth of feathers would shorten the time of reduced plumage functionality. However, it has long been known that feather growth-rate is limited and that long feathers take disproportionally longer to grow than small feathers, which has severe consequences on moult duration and the completeness of moult in large birds. The reasons for the limitations of feather-growth must be related to the size and/or functions of the feather follicle, but are largely unknown. Here we measured the size of the feather follicle (taking calamus width as a proxy) and related it to parameters of feather growth (feather growth-rate by mass and by length) and feather structure (feather length, mass, massiveness [mass of feather material per mm feather-length]). We used three independent datasets which allowed for interspecific analyses, and for intraspecific comparisons of differently structured feathers within the framework of biological scaling. We found that the cross-sectional area of the calamus (as a proxy of feather follicle size) was directly proportional to feather growth-rate by mass. Hence, factors acting at a two-dimensional scale (possibly nutrient supply to the growing feather) determines feather growth rate by mass, rather than the linear arrangement of stem cells (in a circular configuration) as had previously been assumed. Feather follicle size was correlated with both feather length and massiveness, hence it seems to be adapted to some extent to feather structure. Feather growth-rate by length was dependent on both the feather material produced per unit time (growth-rate by mass) and the amount of material deposited per unit feather-length. Follicle size not only determines feather growth-rate by mass, but also directly the structural design (shape, number of barbs, etc.) of a feather. Therefore, feather growth-rate is severely constrained by the requirements imposed by the structural feather design.},

  abstract = {Wing morphology is known to strongly affect flight performance by affecting lift and drag during flight. Performance may consequently deteriorate during feather moult due to the creation of feather gaps in the wing. Since wing gap size may directly affect the extent of reduced flight capacity, rapid moult involving the creation of large feather gaps is expected to substantially impair flight compared with the small gaps induced by a slower moult. To examine the factors affecting wing-feather moult speed, we studied adults of nineteen resident or very short-distance migrant passerine species during their post-breeding moult using a model-selection framework following a phylogenetically controlled analysis. We examined the speed of wing-feather moult in relation to each species' flight distance index that was estimated based on local foraging movements rather than on longer flights (e.g., migration), assessed by the Delphi technique of expert evaluation. Moult speed was also examined with respect to six morphometric variables: body mass, wing loading, the feather comprising the tip of the wing, aspect ratio, wing span, and wing area. Our results suggest that flight distance index is the most important factor determining the speed of wing-feather moult in songbirds. Species that regularly fly a shorter distance were found to moult quickly, and those that take relatively longer flights moult slowly. These results suggest that the aerodynamic cost of wing area reduction due to feather moult shapes the evolution of annual routine processes by dictating a slower moult speed (resulting in small wing gaps) for species that regularly fly long distances and consequently may be affected more substantially by large wing gaps compared with short distance flyers.},

Feather molt is a timely undertaking that is considered among the three most energy-demanding processes in the life cycle of birds. To deal with time pressure, passerines may shorten their molt duration, using three non\textendash mutually exclusive mechanisms: (1) replacing only part of the plumage, (2) increasing the speed of molt, and (3) postponing the renewal of some or all the plumage to a later season (i.e., from the summer to the overwintering period). We used a comparative approach by measuring 12,349 individuals from 134 passerine species to explore how feather molt of juvenile and adult passerines is evolutionarily modulated under time constraints. The results indicate that breeding at northern latitudes and long-distance migration limit the time available for molt and that the consequences of time constraints were age dependent. While the duration of adult summer molt decreased, the extent, rather than the duration, of juvenile molt declined under time constraints. This study highlights the importance of considering time constraints in order to enhance the understanding of selective forces that shape life-history processes and their consequences throughout the annual routine.},

  abstract = {Although feathers are the unifying characteristic of all birds, our understanding of the causes, mechanisms, patterns and consequences of the feather moult process lags behind that of other major avian life-history phenomena such as reproduction and long-distance migration. Migration, which evolved in many species of the temperate and arctic zones, requires high energy expenditure to endure long-distance journeys. About a third of Western-Palearctic passerines perform long-distance migrations of thousands of kilometres each year using various morphological, physiological, biomechanical, behavioural and life-history adaptations. The need to include the largely non-overlapping breeding, long-distance migration and feather moult processes within the annual cycle imposes a substantial constraint on the time over which the moult process can take place. Here, we review four feather-moult-related adaptations which, likely due to time constraints, evolved among long-distance Western-Palearctic migrants: (i) increased moult speed; (ii) increased overlap between moult and breeding or migration; (iii) decreased extent of plumage moult; and (iv) moult of part or all of the plumage during the over-wintering period in the tropics rather than in the breeding areas. We suggest that long-distance migration shaped the evolution of moult strategies and increased the diversity of these strategies among migratory passerines. In contrast to this variation, all resident passerines in the Western Palearctic moult immediately after breeding by renewing the entire plumage of adults and in some species also juveniles, while in other species juvenile moult is partial. We identify important gaps in our current understanding of the moult process that should be addressed in the future. Notably, previous studies suggested that the ancestral moult strategy is a post-breeding summer moult in the Western Palearctic breeding areas and that moult during the winter evolved due to the scheduling of long-distance migration immediately after breeding. We offer an alternative hypothesis based on the notion of southern ancestry, proposing that the ancestral moult strategy was a complete moult during the `northern winter' in the Afro-tropical region in these species, for both adults and juveniles. An important aspect of the observed variation in moult strategies relates to their control mechanisms and we suggest that there is insufficient knowledge regarding the physiological mechanisms that are involved, and whether they are genetically fixed or shaped by environmental factors. Finally, research effort is needed on how global climate changes may influence avian annual routines by altering the scheduling of major processes such as long-distance migration and feather moult.},

In birds, individual appearance is largely determined by plumage, influencing, for example, bird attractiveness, social status and camouflage. Juveniles of most passerine species replace their nest-grown plumage during the first months of life, a process that is called post-juvenile feather moult. Using data from ten natural history collections, we show that the extent of the post-juvenile moult has increased significantly over the last 212 years (1805\textendash 2016), a trend that is positively correlated with the temperature of the environment. Therefore, it seems that birds replaced more feathers under warmer conditions, causing juveniles to appear more similar to adult birds. Moreover, in several species, we describe a male\textendash female switch in the extent of moult, with females currently replacing more feathers than males compared to the past. These results demonstrate different biological responses to climate warming by different phenotypes.},

  abstract = {Plumage renewal is an important process in the avian yearly cycle, yet knowledge about the factors that shape moult strategies is far from complete. A varying proportion of individuals of several Palaearctic passerine species divide their flight-feather moult between breeding and wintering areas. Here we focus on split moult, which includes retaining some or all the secondary feathers during the main moult period (interrupted moult) and later renewal of these feathers (complementary moult), after migration or breeding. We built a large moult database (213 species, 64 076 individuals) to describe split moult pattern in Palaearctic passerines, identify its frequency and test whether it is more common in long-distance migrants than in short-distance migrants and sedentary species. We found that first-year individuals, tested shortly after the main moult period, exhibited interrupted moult, yet individuals tested later in the annual cycle also retained non-moulted secondaries. In contrast, in most species, adults tested later in the annual cycle had fully renewed flight-feathers. This would suggest that age may be a factor associated with the probability of exhibiting split moult, as this strategy was more common in adults than in first-year birds. Furthermore, we found that interrupted and split moults occur more often among long-distance migrants than among sedentary or short-distance migrants. Our results probably imply that the split flight-feather moult is not initiated in the first winter of the bird's life, as has been suggested in previous studies. In addition, the occurrence of split moult among long-distance migrants in which the main moult takes place during the winter and among sedentary or short-distance migratory species, suggests that split moult probably does not represent an evolutionary transition between summer and winter moult; in both species groups, an evolutionary transition towards winter moult is probably impossible. Based on our findings, we suggest that split moult may be a moult strategy that allows birds to cope with time and energy constraints during the main moult period by retaining part of their flight-feathers and resuming their moult later in the yearly cycle.},

Our analysis suggests that the ancestral molt strategy of first-year birds was partial or entirely absent, and that complete wing flight-feather molt in first-year birds first evolved in the late Eocene and Oligocene (25\textendash 40~Ma), at least 30 Myr after birds first evolved. Complete flight-feather molt occurred mainly at equatorial latitudes and in relatively low body mass species, following a diversification of body mass within the lineage. We conclude that both body mass and geographic distribution shaped the evolution of molt strategies and propose that the evolutionary transition towards complete juvenile molt in the Neornithes is a novel, relatively late adaptation.},

My results show that male chaffinches prefer to sing below the canopy of mature pines and in the uppermost parts of sapling pines. Although these are the canopy parts most exposed to sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) attacks, staying in open sites may be a beneficial strategy for singing chaffinches because it makes it possible to improve antipredatory vigilance. This assumption was supported by the hawk experiments. After being exposed to the sparrowhawk model, all of the singing birds selected the conspicuous perch below the canopy of mature pines. The males that perched higher in the canopy before the experiment moved to the lower canopy, whereas those males that sang below the canopy did not change their singing perch.},

Over a period of 36 years (1985\textendash 2020), we observed 199 attacks of Eurasian Sparrowhawks on mixed-species flocks of small forest passerines, with 19 attacks being successful (9.6\%). Sparrowhawks attacked mainly from either above the canopy of mature conifers or just below the lower branches of the canopy. Attacks by sparrowhawks were more successful in the lower canopy (N = 17) than the upper canopy (N = 2). Fourteen of the 19 songbirds killed by sparrowhawks were Goldcrests (Regulus regulus), Willow Tits (Poecile montanus), and Coal Tits (Periparus ater), small songbirds typically limited to the lower canopy by larger, more dominant species that occupy the upper canopy. Sparrowhawk attacks on birds located in the upper canopy were rarely successful, likely because songbirds in the upper canopy are more concealed by the vegetation and more likely to detect approaching predators. Our results suggest that the spatial segregation of members of mixed-species groups of wintering songbirds can be explained by their responses to microhabitat (canopy height) gradients in predator exposure that are enforced by group dominance hierarchies.},

Chickadees also gave significantly more introductory notes, often used in association with the presence of predators or risk, in their calls when the eyes were visible than when the eyes of the predator model were covered.

Rapid reversible physiological changes during different life\textendash history stages are virtually only known from long\textendash distance migrants, and few studies have focused on less extreme aspects of organ flexibility. During moult, birds suffer from increased wing loading due to wing\textendash area reductions, which may impair flight ability. A previous study found that tree sparrows' escape flight (Passer montanus) is unaffected during moult, suggesting compensatory aptness. We used non\textendash invasive techniques to study physiological adaptations to increased wing loading in tree sparrows. As wing area was reduced during natural moult the ratio of pectoral\textendash muscle size to body mass increased. When moult was completed this ratio decreased. We show experimentally a novel, strategic, organ\textendash flexibility pattern. Unlike the general pattern, where body mass is positively coupled to pectoral\textendash muscle size, tree sparrows responded within 7 days to reductions in wing area by reducing body mass concurrently with an increase in pectoral\textendash muscle size. This rapid flexibility in a non\textendash migratory species probably reflects the paramount importance and long history of flight in birds.},

Evasive abilities in birds have been found to be detrimentally affected by migratory fuel load, reproduction and moult. These results suggest that during these periods of their lives birds suffer from increased predation risk due to impaired evasive abilities. 2. Theoretically, moult should have a detrimental effect on flight, and empirical work on starlings has shown impaired escape ability due to moult. However, a recent theoretical investigation found a surprisingly small effect of moult on flight in birds. 3. In this study, 31 Tree Sparrows, a sedentary species with a slow moult, were used to investigate the effect of natural and manipulated moult on escape ability. No effect was found due to natural moult, however, when experimentally increasing moult gap size a strong negative effect was found. 4. With support from empirical and theoretical work, this is the first study to suggest that slow moult may not increase predation risk due to impaired evasive abilities. Compensatory physiological adaptations probably cause this result and may be very important during moult. 5. Predation risk is probably an important factor in the evolution of moult patterns and moult strategies.}

  abstract = {The cost of feather production, Cf (kJ {$\cdot$} [g dry feathers]{$^{-1}$}), differs substantially between species. We studied the molt cost in one insectivorous songbird (bluethroat, Luscinia s. svecica) and one granivorous songbird (common redpoll, Carduelis f. flammea). We wanted to test whether diferences in diet, body mass (or basal metabolic rate, BMR), or the latitude of molt could explain interspecific differences. In each individual, the resting metabolism, as measured by indirect calorimetry, was positively correlated with feather production rate. The cost of feather synthesis was estimated at 836 and 683 kJ {$\cdot$} (g dry feathers){$^{-1}$} in the bluethroats and redpolls, respectively. The efciency of feather production was 2.6\% and 3.1\%. It was concluded that neither diet nor latitudinal constraints alone could explain the differences found between species. The cost of feather production was significantly correlated with both body mass and mass-specific BMR, BMRm (kJ {$\cdot$} g{$^{-1}$} {$\cdot$} d{$^{-1}$}), where BMRm currently showed the highest degree of explanation, although other factors that influence BMRm cannot be discounted. The Cf for a species with known BMRm may be estimated from the equation Cf = 270 BMRm. Species with a relatively high BMR for their size also have a relatively high Cf. The tight association of Cf and BMRm between species, and the low efciency values of feather synthesis, suggests that feather production costs include more than the costs for keratin synthesis: they mainly consist of costs of maintaining tissues necessary for feather production.},

One group (Control group) was held under light conditions simulating the natural light regime of their moulting grounds at 66\textdegree N latitude. The light regime of another group (Shifted group) was similar to the Control group, but shifted 1 month forward, simulating light conditions further into autumn. All birds had food ad libitum. In addition, comparisons were made with free-living bluethroats. There were no differences in moult performance (start and speed) between the Control group and the Shifted group, and moult was similar to that of free-living birds. The start of moult may be endogenously controlled and set earlier in the season so the change in light regime for the Shifted group may have come too late to influence moult performance. The rate of moult may also be inflexible, in spite of the imposed time stress. In addition, bluethroats may moult so fast that further acceleration would hamper flight manoeuvrability and feeding efficiency. Whereas the Control group birds first started to deposit fat when moult was finished, as free-living birds do, the Shifted group birds started fat deposition in mid-moult. Also, the fat deposition rate following completion of moult was higher in the Shifted group. Thus, adult bluethroats can adjust the timing and speed of fat deposition in relation to moult and time of season. Such flexibility should be advantageous for migratory birds moulting at high latitudes where time available between breeding and migration is short.},

  abstract = {Jameson Land, East Greenland is a moulting area of c. 5000 non-breeding Pink-footed Geese and 5000 Barnacle Geese. Breeding populations of both species in the area are small and scattered. The moulting Pinkfeet originate from Iceland, and the Barnacle Geese from other parts of East Greenland. Both species arrive in the area at the end of June and moult their remiges in July. Moulting flocks of the two species seldom mix. Pinkfoot flocks are common along coastlines, in wide rivers and on lakes with open views to all sides, while Barnacle Geese predominate in smaller rivers and on lakes with surrounding hills. During moult the geese, and especially the Pinkfeet, are extremely wary and depend on a safe area of water serving as a refuge with nearby food supplies (sedge-dominated marshes). Barnacle Geese graze in a zone 0\textendash 100 m from the refuge, Pinkfeet up to 200\textendash 250 m from the refuge. The moulting sites fill up with geese according to available marsh areas, and the grazing pressure on average amounts to 594 goose-days per ha during the moulting period. Food intake is estimated at 149 g and 138 g organic material per 24 h by Pinkfeet and Barnacle Geese, respectively, [n 1984, which was sunny and warm, net above-ground primary production of a Carex subspathacea marsh (the prime feeding ground during moult) from the beginning of growth to the end of July was 13\textendash 15 g dw m2, and it is estimated that the geese consumed 60\textendash 69\% of the production. In 1983, which was cold, geese probably consumed the entire production. Goose grazing did not affect productivity, but nutrient levels were high in grazed compared with ungrazed shoots, and peaked in early July. When separate, the diet of both species comprises sedges and grasses. Where the species co-exist the amount of mosses in the diet increases, especially in Barnacle Geese. With respect to nutrient and fibre contents, moss is a suboptimal food compared to sedges and grasses. When separate, the geese spend 41\textendash 46\% of the 24 hr grazing. Where they co-exist, Barnacle Geese spend 62\% of the time grazing, while Pinkfeet seem unaffected by the presence of Barnacle Geese. It is argued that carrying capacity for moulting geese is reached. Geese compete for resources, the Barnacle Goose suffering from the presence of the other. The observed distribution pattern is suggested to result from (1) Pinkfeet being limited to certain sites due to extreme wariness, and (2) Barnacle Geese trying to avoid competition by utilizing sites which Pinkfeet are reluctant to use. The experience of older Barnacle Geese of stress when settling with Pinkfeet may be the segregation mechanism. Moult coincides with the onset of growth and peak nutrient levels in the vegetation. It is suggested that the geese undertake moult migrations to Jameson Land both to avoid competition for resources with breeding geese and because they gain advantage from a growing, nutritious vegetation.},

However, proximate factors modulating the potential trade-off between moult and breeding, such as haemoparasite infection and stress, have not been studied in wild avian populations. We investigated the occurrence of moult-breeding overlap in females of a Spanish population of pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) and its association with female age, haemoparasite prevalences, physiological stress, and condition at initial (incubation phase or beginning of the nestling period) and final breeding stages (days11'12 of the nestling period). Late-breeding females were more likely to show a moult\textemdash breeding overlap than early-breeding females. Female age was not associated with moult status when taking into account laying date and study year. A higher proportion of females infected by Haemoproteus at initial breeding stages showed a moult\textemdash breeding overlap. Haemoproteus prevalences at final breeding stages did not differ according to moult status. Females with a moult\textemdash breeding overlap also showed better condition and lower stress levels (HSP60 levels) at the end of the season. A higher proportion of moulting females returned to the breeding grounds in the following season compared with non-moulting ones. Conversely, moulting females showed reduced hatching success and numbers of hatchlings and fledglings. Overlapping moult and breeding might be the expression of a shift in resource allocation between present and future reproduction, towards increased self-maintenance and reduced reproductive investment.},

  abstract = {Moult is one of the three main energy-demanding events in the yearly cycles of birds, and in most species occurs at a different time from breeding and migration. The sequence in which these events occur varies according to the ecological circumstances in which particular populations live, and in general moult is more variable in timing than other events. Some migratory birds moult in their breeding areas after nesting is over; others moult at a staging area on migration; while others moult in winter quarters. Yet others show a split moult, replacing part of their plumage in one place and part in another, moult being arrested during the intervening migration. Different variants in these patterns occur in different populations of the same species. Some types of birds overlap breeding and moult, and some also overlap moult and migration, especially body moult which can occur without reducing flight efficiency. Most of our knowledge of moult is based on museum skins and, now that appropriate statistical models are available to analyse it, moult is increasingly being studied in free-living birds, the main parameters of ecological interest being its timing and duration. Recent models for analysing moult data, and some of the pitfalls, are discussed briefly in this paper. More field study of moult is needed, particularly because of its relevance to annual cycle and population processes, and hence to its potential application in conservation-based research. Ringers are the only people at present able to fill this gap in knowledge.},

(2) A parent bird trying to maximize amount of food delivered to its young should fly faster, at the penalty of increased energy expenditure on travel, than the maximum range speed (which involves minimum energy cost per unit distance flown). Regardless of the distances flown, birds should increase speed as long as the concomitant increment in travel costs can be more than compensated by foraging in the travel time saved.

Traditional ground-based measures of predation risk are location specific and limited in spatial resolution. We demonstrate the benefits of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) to map the properties of vegetation structure that shape fearscapes. We used TLS data to estimate the concealment of prey from multiple vantage points, representing predator sightlines, as well as the visibility of potential predators from the locations of prey. TLS provides a comprehensive data set that allows an exploration of how habitat changes may affect prey and predators. Together with other remotely sensed imagery, TLS could facilitate the scaling up of fearscape analyses to promote the management and restoration of landscapes.},

In this chapter I explore how the mechanics of flapping flight have molded the flight adaptations of birds. The paper has three main threads. First, I describe recent theoretical and experimental studies on flapping flight aerodynamics and demonstrate how the mechanical requirements of locomotion are reflected in wingbeat kinematics, in vortex wake structure, and in the action of the pectoral musculature. Next, I consider how flight performance varies with size; scaling has become a central tool in the analysis of flight in birds and has proved a useful means of predicting how different mechanical, physiological, and ecological parameters change in importance with size, morphology, and behavior. However, scaling is frequently misinterpreted: it is size-dependence of the constraints on adaptation which lead to allometric consistency in avian flight morphology, and many of these constraints can be related directly to flight mechanics. Finally, I use a multivariate analysis of wing morphology to demonstrate how these constraints interact to different degrees in different birds and underlie correlations among flight morphology, ecology, and behavior. These threads are then brought together in a discussion of the conjectural relationships between fitness and the evolution of specializations in flight morphology.},

  abstract = {Organismal movement is ubiquitous and facilitates important ecological mechanisms that drive community and metacommunity composition and hence biodiversity. In most existing ecological theories and models in biodiversity research, movement is represented simplistically, ignoring the behavioural basis of movement and consequently the variation in behaviour at species and individual levels. However, as human endeavours modify climate and land use, the behavioural processes of organisms in response to these changes, including movement, become critical to understanding the resulting biodiversity loss. Here, we draw together research from different subdisciplines in ecology to understand the impact of individual-level movement processes on community-level patterns in species composition and coexistence. We join the movement ecology framework with the key concepts from metacommunity theory, community assembly and modern coexistence theory using the idea of micro\textendash macro links, where various aspects of emergent movement behaviour scale up to local and regional patterns in species mobility and mobile-link-generated patterns in abiotic and biotic environmental conditions. These in turn influence both individual movement and, at ecological timescales, mechanisms such as dispersal limitation, environmental filtering, and niche partitioning. We conclude by highlighting challenges to and promising future avenues for data generation, data analysis and complementary modelling approaches and provide a brief outlook on how a new behaviour-based view on movement becomes important in understanding the responses of communities under ongoing environmental change.},

  abstract = {Habitat urbanization may change the density of predators, and it is often assumed that such changes lead to altered predation risk for urban populations of their prey. Although it is difficult to study predation hazard directly, behavior responses of prey species may be informative in inferring such habitat differences. In this study, we compared the risk-taking behavior of urban and rural house sparrows (Passer domesticus) after simulated attacks by two of their important predators (sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus and domestic cat Felis catus). The birds were startled by moving dummies of these predators and respective control objects, and their risk taking was estimated as their latency to feed after the startle. We found that sparrows responded more strongly (had longer post-startle feeding latencies) to sparrowhawk attacks than to the control object, and their responses differed between the habitats. First, risk taking of urban birds strongly decreased with age (older birds had longer latencies than young birds), while there was no such age difference in rural birds. Second, young urban birds responded less strongly, while older urban birds responded more strongly to the sparrowhawk than the same age groups of rural birds, respectively. We did not succeed in evoking antipredatory response by simulated cat attacks, because birds responded similarly to the dummy and the control object. Our results support that predation risk, posed at least by avian predators, is different in urban and rural habitats of house sparrows. The increased wariness of older, hence presumably more experienced, urban birds implies that sparrows may be more exposed to predation in cities.},

Birds with accelerated moulting rate showed a smaller yellow patch with lower yellow reflectance compared to their slow-moulting counterparts. Considering that the time available for moulting is usually constrained between the end of the breeding season and migration or wintering, carotenoid feather ornaments, whose expression is mediated by moult speed, may convey long term information about an individual's condition, potentially encompassing the previous breeding season. Furthermore, the observed trade-off between moult speed and ornament expression may represent a previously unrecognized selective advantage for early breeding birds.},

Step-selection functions (SSFs) are commonly used to link environmental covariates to animal location data collected at fine temporal resolution. SSFs are estimated by comparing observed steps connecting successive animal locations to random steps, using a likelihood equivalent of a Cox proportional hazards model. By using common statistical distributions to model step length and turn angle distributions, and including habitat- and movement-related covariates (functions of distances between points, angular deviations), it is possible to make inference regarding habitat selection and movement processes or to control one process while investigating the other. The fitted model can also be used to estimate utilization distributions and mechanistic home ranges. Here, we present the R package amt (animal movement tools) that allows users to fit SSFs to data and to simulate space use of animals from fitted models. The amt package also provides tools for managing telemetry data. Using fisher (Pekania pennanti) data as a case study, we illustrate a four-step approach to the analysis of animal movement data, consisting of data management, exploratory data analysis, fitting of models, and simulating from fitted models.},

The Autocorrelated Kernel Density Estimation (AKDE) family of estimators were designed to be statistically efficient while explicitly dealing with the complexities of modern movement data: autocorrelation, small sample sizes, and missing or irregularly sampled data. Although each of these estimators has been described in separate technical papers, here we review how these estimators work and provide a user-friendly guide on how they may be combined to reduce multiple biases simultaneously.  3. We describe the magnitude of the improvements offered by these estimators and their impact on home range area estimates, using both empirical case studies and simulations, contrasting their computational costs. 4. Finally, we provide guidelines for researchers to choose among alternative estimators and an R script to facilitate the application and interpretation of AKDE home range estimates.},

Indirect predictions have been made concerning the impact of primary length and asymmetry on the flight ability of birds, but they have not been explicitly tested. Here we provide evidence from both natural variation in primary feather condition and experimental manipulations of primary feather length and asymmetry to indicate that these factors influence aspects of flight performance in the Common Starling Sturnus vulgaris. Damaged and incompletely grown primary feathers reduce escape flight performance. Experimentally reduced primary lengths reduce take-off speed; increased primary asymmetry decreases aerial manoeuvrability. A comparison of the experimental and natural plumage data indicates that birds may be able to adapt to a change in wing morphology, perhaps reducing the effects of feather loss or damage on flight. The results from this study indicate that primary feathers are under strong stabilising selection to maximise developmental homeostasis and reduce feather asymmetry. These findings are also of ecological importance to the damage-avoidance and moult strategies of these birds. This is the first experimental evidence to indicate a quantitative reduction in flight performance with feather lengths and asymmetries typical of those observed during flight feather moult and feather damage in any species.}

By altering the plumage to simulate moult, we have isolated the biomechanical consequences of changes in wingform from the underlying physiological and metabolic changes that may occur during natural moult. Previous analyses of avian take-off performance have relied on descriptive observations of wingtip kinematics or dual measures of take-off speed and angle. We have developed a novel method using the energy gain per wingbeat as a measure of overall take-off performance. The advantages of this measure compared with previous approaches are that it summarises the potential trade-off between height gain and speed gain, and can be related directly to lift on the wings. Analysis of high speed (100 Hz) video tapes indicated that birds in simulated moult suffer a reduction in total energy produced during the second wingbeat of take-off, resulting in a slower take-off speed. This reduction in take-off performance is also associated with a marked change to the pattern of movement of the wingtip during flight; moult-manipulated birds appear to reverse the wingtip at the top of the downstroke although there is no associated change in wingbeat amplitude or duration. Birds appeared to be able to regain, in part, their flight performance within 6 days of the manipulations, as take-off speeds returned to pre-manipulation levels. This partial return to pre-manipulation flight performance was associated with an alteration in pattern of movement of the wingtip during take-off. The relevance of this adaptation to birds in natural moult is discussed. Any reduction in take-off performance is likely to influence directly individual behaviour and survival; hence the ability to quantify take-off in different species under a common currency is of general ecological importance and will enable predictions to be generated and tested concerning the effects of natural moult in wild birds.]}

I obtained a mean of 42 locations of 84 radio-tagged female cowbirds on three study sites in Illinois and Missouri. Radio-tagged females usually were located in forest and shrub-sapling habitats with a mean of 1.4 males during the morning breeding period. During midmorning to early afternoon, females commuted to short-grass, cropland, and feedlot habitats; they fed in small flocks. At dusk females roosted singly or in small groups near breeding or feeding areas, or commuted to a large communal roost. Behavior and time of day, behavior and habitat use, and habitat use and time of day were highly associated. For approximately 90\% of the radio-tagged cowbirds, breeding, feeding, and roosting locations were distributed nonrandomly within home ranges, and came from distinct utilization distributions. Cowbirds moved an average of 3.6 km between roosting and breeding locations, 1.2 km between breeding and feeding locations, and 2.6 km between feeding and roosting locations. Midwestern cowbirds show the same pattern of commuting between disjunct breeding and feeding areas as elsewhere in their range.},

This has led to new opportunities and challenges when investigating animal movement behaviour and habitat selection. Tools like Step Selection Functions (SSFs) are relatively new powerful models for studying resource selection by animals moving through the landscape. SSFs compare environmental attributes of observed steps (the linear segment between two consecutive observations of position) with alternative random steps taken from the same starting point. SSFs have been used to study habitat selection, human-wildlife interactions, movement corridors, and dispersal behaviours in animals. SSFs also have the potential to depict resource selection at multiple spatial and temporal scales. There are several aspects of SSFs where consensus has not yet been reached such as how to analyse the data, when to consider habitat covariates along linear paths between observations rather than at their endpoints, how many random steps should be considered to measure availability, and how to account for individual variation. In this review we aim to address all these issues, as well as to highlight weak features of this modelling approach that should be developed by further research. Finally, we suggest that SSFs could be integrated with state-space models to classify behavioural states when estimating SSFs.},

Science, this issue p. 194, p. 188; see also p. 142 Seven decades of research on the ``cognitive map,'' the allocentric representation of space, have yielded key neurobiological insights, yet field evidence from free-ranging wild animals is still lacking. Using a system capable of tracking dozens of animals simultaneously at high accuracy and resolution, we assembled a large dataset of 172 foraging Egyptian fruit bats comprising {$>$}18 million localizations collected over 3449 bat-nights across 4 years. Detailed track analysis, combined with translocation experiments and exhaustive mapping of fruit trees, revealed that wild bats seldom exhibit random search but instead repeatedly forage in goal-directed, long, and straight flights that include frequent shortcuts. Alternative, non\textendash map-based strategies were ruled out by simulations, time-lag embedding, and other trajectory analyses. Our results are consistent with expectations from cognitive map\textendash like navigation and support previous neurobiological evidence from captive bats.

Recent advances in field-portable, high-speed video systems, coupled with precise anemometry, permit measures of high-speed aerial performance of birds in a natural state. We undertook the present study to test: (i) the manner in which barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) may exploit wind dynamics and ground effect while foraging and (ii) the relative importance of flapping versus gliding for accomplishing high-speed manoeuvers. Using multi-camera videography synchronized with wind-velocity measurements, we tracked coursing manoeuvers in pursuit of prey. Wind speed averaged 1.3\textendash 2.0 m s-1 across the atmospheric boundary layer, exhibiting a shear gradient greater than expected, with instantaneous speeds of 0.02\textendash 6.1 m s-1. While barn swallows tended to flap throughout turns, they exhibited reduced wingbeat frequency, relying on glides and partial bounds during maximal manoeuvers. Further, the birds capitalized on the near-earth wind speed gradient to gain kinetic and potential energy during both flapping and gliding turns; providing evidence that such behaviour is not limited to large, fixed-wing soaring seabirds and that exploitation of wind gradients by small aerial insectivores may be a significant aspect of their aeroecology.

We describe the system in detail and show that it produces accurate location estimates in real settings and over long periods of time. Localization errors of wild animals carrying our transmitters have standard deviation of about 5m and mean of 5-15m. If we restrict the system to operate in the center of the receiver's band-pass filters, the mean error drops to about 5m. We also show how to reliably quantify the error in each individual location estimate. In addition to the characterization of accuracy, we introduce three technical innovations in the system. First, a method to model the error of individual time-of- arrival measurements, enabling correct weighing of the data to estimate locations and allowing estimation of the covariance matrix of each location estimate. Second, extensive use of known- position beacon transmitters, to synchronize the clocks of receivers (radio-frequency TOA localization require accurate clocks), to characterize and continuously monitor the performance of the system, and to model arrival- time-estimation errors.

  abstract = {Billions of songbirds migrate between continents twice each year, but the energy costs of this feat have never been measured for free-flying individuals. Here we follow New World Catharus thrushes during their nocturnal migratory flights1,2, recapturing individuals after journeys of up to 600 km and determining their energy expenditure by using doubly labelled water3,4. Although flight itself is costly, our results confirm the counterintuitive prediction that songbirds expend double the amount of energy during stopovers that they spend on flight over their entire migration5,6.},

  abstract = {The effects of natural moult on avian flight performance have received relatively little attention, yet moult is an important part of the annual cycle. Quantification of flight costs will help to explain the diversity of moult patterns observed in avian taxa. Take-off from the ground requires a high power output from the flight muscles compared to other modes of flight, and is an important feature of foraging and predation escape. The present study was designed to quantify the effect of natural moult and new plumage on the take-off strategy, kinematics, and flight performance of European starlings Sturnus vulgaris. A high-speed (185 Hz) cine camera was used to film seven European starlings on three occasions: session 1, two weeks prior to the onset of moult; session 2, during mid-moult; and session 3, two weeks after full plumage had re-grown. From subsequent film analysis, we assessed take-off speed and angle, the energy gained per wingbeat, and wingtip kinematics. Take-off strategy (measured by angle and speed) altered through the course of the three experimental sessions, i.e. ascent angle decreased and take-off speed increased. Energy gained per wingbeat did not vary, suggesting there was no significant decrease in flight performance due to moult, but there was a significant improvement in take-off performance due to renewal of flight plumage. Wingbeat amplitude increased in association with moult and after flight plumage had been completely renewed. The European starlings incurred relatively minor flight costs due to moult, when comparing before-moult with during-moult take-off performance. The apparent absence of additional flight costs associated with moult may reflect a decreased mechanical performance of year-old feathers (which are replaced during the moult) and may also help to explain the relatively long duration of the moult in this species. This study also provides evidence of the benefits of plumage renewal, as take-off performance is improved after moult has been completed.},

  abstract = {The first edition of this book has established itself as one of the leading references on generalized additive models (GAMs), and the only book on the topic to be introductory in nature with a wealth of practical examples and software implementation. It is self-contained, providing the necessary background in linear models, linear mixed models, and generalized linear models (GLMs), before presenting a balanced treatment of the theory and applications of GAMs and related models.   The author bases his approach on a framework of penalized regression splines, and while firmly focused on the practical aspects of GAMs, discussions include fairly full explanations of the theory underlying the methods. Use of R software helps explain the theory and illustrates the practical application of the methodology. Each chapter contains an extensive set of exercises, with solutions in an appendix or in the book's R data package gamair, to enable use as a course text or for self-study. Simon N. Wood is a professor of Statistical Science at the University of Bristol, UK, and author of the R package mgcv.},
