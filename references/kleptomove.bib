  abstract = {One important challenge of spatial ecology is to generate models linking individual behavior to population-level phenomena. Although animals often face great uncertainty regarding foraging patch quality, earlier models explaining the aggregation of animals have rarely specified how stable outcomes are achieved through individual decisions, especially under realistic assumptions for incompletely informed foragers. We developed a new foraging model that assumed a realistic decision-making rule for incompletely informed group foragers, and we tested its performance against existing models with different assumptions by comparing how well they reproduce the patterns observed in foraging White-fronted Geese (Anser albifrons). The assumptions in each of the four compared models were: (1) incompletely informed foraging with benefits of group foraging, which uses the expected gain rates for making decisions on diet choice, patch departure, and flock joining; (2) incompletely informed foraging without benefits of group foraging, which uses the expected gain rates to determine the timing of patch departure but selects a new patch randomly; (3) completely informed foraging without benefits of group foraging, which simply selects the most profitable patches; and (4) completely informed foraging with benefits of group foraging, which selects the most profitable patches, considering benefits from the presence of conspecifics. The model that assumed incompletely informed foragers with benefits of group foraging was best in agreement with the observed patterns in all of the five spatial distribution and fat deposition parameters. The models that assumed no benefits of group foraging could not reproduce the observed seasonal variation in flock sizes, whereas the models with completely informed foragers overestimated the flock size as well as usage by the geese of alternative food and the fields near the roost. These results supported the idea that the geese can be assumed to use the expected gain rates for decision-making on diet choice, patch departure, and flock joining. Further, the incompletely informed foragers showed greater disparity in foraging performance among individuals. We discuss the necessity of assuming, when appropriate, that foragers have incomplete information on patch quality in models explaining spatial distribution and foraging success. We also make some references to the applicability of the presented model in other studies.},

The identification of local patterns of spatial association is an important concern in this respect. In this paper, I outline a new general class of local indicators of spatial association (LISA) and show how they allow for the decomposition of global indicators, such as Moran's I, into the contribution of each observation. The LISA statistics serve two purposes. On one hand, they may be interpreted as indicators of local pockets of nonstationarity, or hot spots, similar to the Gi and G*i statistics of Getis and Ord (1992). On the other hand, they may be used to assess the influence of individual locations on the magnitude of the global statistic and to identify ?outliers,? as in Anselin's Moran scatterplot (1993a). An initial evaluation of the properties of a LISA statistic is carried out for the local Moran, which is applied in a study of the spatial pattern of conflict for African countries and in a number of Monte Carlo simulations.},

We then propose a mathematical framework for considering problems of competitive exclusion, and provide examples in which n competitors can coexist on k {$<$} n resources (both biotic and abiotic). These systems persist because of internally generated cyclic behavior. We conclude that the competitive exclusion principle applies in general only to coexistence at fixed densities.},

While the segregation of populations into interconnected demes has been shown to influence the evolution of generalism, the role of local interactions between individuals is unclear. Here, we combine an individual-based model of microbial communities with a well-established framework of genetic specificity that matches empirical observations of bacterium-phage interactions. We find the evolution of generalism in well-mixed populations to be highly sensitive to the severity of associated fitness costs, but the constraining effect of costs on the evolution of generalism is lessened in spatially structured populations. The contrasting outcomes between the two environments can be explained by different scales of competition (i.e., global vs. local). These findings suggest that local interactions may have important effects on the evolution of generalism in host-parasite interactions, particularly in the presence of high fitness costs.},

  abstract = {A resource selection function is a model of the likelihood that an available spatial unit will be used by an animal, given its resource value. But how do we appropriately define availability? Step selection analysis deals with this problem at the scale of the observed positional data, by matching each ‘used step’ (connecting two consecutive observed positions of the animal) with a set of ‘available steps’ randomly sampled from a distribution of observed steps or their characteristics. Here we present a simple extension to this approach, termed integrated step selection analysis (iSSA), which relaxes the implicit assumption that observed movement attributes (i.e. velocities and their temporal autocorrelations) are independent of resource selection. Instead, iSSA relies on simultaneously estimating movement and resource selection parameters, thus allowing simple likelihood-based inference of resource selection within a mechanistic movement model. We provide theoretical underpinning of iSSA, as well as practical guidelines to its implementation. Using computer simulations, we evaluate the inferential and predictive capacity of iSSA compared to currently used methods. Our work demonstrates the utility of iSSA as a general, flexible and user-friendly approach for both evaluating a variety of ecological hypotheses, and predicting future ecological patterns.},

  abstract = {Despite being widely used, habitat selection models are rarely reliable and informative when applied across different ecosystems or over time. One possible explanation is that habitat selection is context-dependent due to variation in consumer density and/or resource availability. The goal of this paper is to provide a general theoretical perspective on the contributory mechanisms of consumer and resource density-dependent habitat selection, as well as on our capacity to account for their effects. Towards this goal we revisit the ideal free distribution (IFD), where consumers are assumed to be omniscient, equally competitive and freely moving, and are hence expected to instantaneously distribute themselves across a heterogeneous landscape such that fitness is equalised across the population. Although these assumptions are clearly unrealistic to some degree, the simplicity of the structure in IFD provides a useful theoretical vantage point to help clarify our understanding of more complex spatial processes. Of equal importance, IFD assumptions are compatible with the assumptions underlying common habitat selection models. Here we show how a fitness-maximising space use model, based on IFD, gives rise to resource and consumer density-dependent shifts in consumer distribution, providing a mechanistic explanation for the context-dependent outcomes often reported in habitat selection analysis. Our model suggests that adaptive shifts in consumer distribution patterns would be expected to lead to nonlinear and often non-monotonic patterns of habitat selection. These results indicate that even under the simplest of assumptions about adaptive organismal behaviour, habitat selection strength should critically depend on system-wide characteristics. Clarifying the impact of adaptive behavioural responses may be pivotal in making meaningful ecological inferences about observed patterns of habitat selection and allow reliable transferability of habitat selection predictions across time and space.},

It collects seven essays, originally published in a broad range of journals, and adds an extensive new introduction to the collection, along with new prefaces to each essay and a useful new appendix of additional resources. Written in Axelrod's acclaimed, accessible style, this collection serves as an introductory text on complexity theory and computer modeling in the social sciences and as an overview of the current state of the art in the field. The articles move beyond the basic paradigm of the Prisoner's Dilemma to study a rich set of issues, including how to cope with errors in perception or implementation, how norms emerge, and how new political actors and regions of shared culture can develop. They use the shared methodology of agent-based modeling, a powerful technique that specifies the rules of interaction between individuals and uses computer simulation to discover emergent properties of the social system. The Complexity of Cooperation is essential reading for all social scientists who are interested in issues of cooperation and complexity.},

Moreover, the degree of competitiveness varies considerably across individuals and in time. By means of an evolutionary model, we provide an explanation for this finding. We make the assumption that investment into competitiveness enhances the probability to acquire a high-quality resource, but at the same time reduces the ability of exploiting acquired resources with maximal efficiency. The model reveals that under a broad range of conditions competitiveness either converges to a polymorphic state, where individuals differing in competitive ability stably coexist, or is subject to perpetual transitions between periods of high and low competitiveness. The dynamics becomes even more complex if females can evolve preferences for (or against) competitive males. In extreme cases, such preferences can even drive the population to extinction.},

When a and k equal one, this equation is equivalent to the matching relation: B1/B2 = r1/r2. Two types of deviation from matching can occur with this formulation: a and k not equal to one. In some experiments, a systematically falls short of one. This deviation is undermatching. The reasons for undermatching are obscure at present. Some evidence suggests, however, that factors favoring discrimination also favor matching. Matching (a = 1) may represent the norm in choice when discrimination is maximal. When k differs from one, its magnitude indicates the degree of bias in choice. The generalized matching law predicts that bias should take this form (adding a constant proportion of responding to the favored alternative).

Producer–scrounger (PS) models predict that at equilibrium scrounging will increase with group size and with patch richness but will be independent of food patch encounter rate. Earlier PS models assume that foragers arrive instantaneously at scrounged food patches, which is not realistic at the habitat level, at which food patches can be far apart. Here, I develop a spatially explicit model of producing and scrounging in which individuals pay a time cost when travelling to scrounged food patches and may join patches with little or no food left when they arrive. Using a genetic-algorithm approach, I confirm that scrounging increases with patch richness and add several novel predictions. In particular, scrounging is expected to increase with a decrease in food patch encounter rate and can actually decrease when forager density is high. In habitats in which food intake rate increases with the number of foragers at food patches, scrounging at low forager densities is actually predicted to increase success. The spatial model also highlights the self-organizing nature of scrounging. Because scrounging reduces the average distance between foragers, thus reducing the costs of joining, attempts to scrounge make further scrounging more likely to evolve. The spatial model of producing and scrounging provides novel insights into the evolution of group foraging.},

  abstract = {An ecological economic model of trawling is presented to demonstrate the effect of trawling location choice strategy on net input (rate of economic gain of fish caught per time spent less costs). Fishing location choice is considered to be a dynamic process whereby trawlers chose from among a repertoire of plastic strategies that they modify if their gains fall below a fixed proportion of the mean gains of the fleet as a whole. The distribution of fishing across different areas of a fishery follows an approximate ideal free distribution (IFD) with varying noise due to uncertainty. The least-productive areas are not utilised because initial net input never reaches the mean yield of better areas subject to competitive exploitation. In cases, where there is a weak temporal autocorrelation between fish stocks in a specific location, a plastic strategy of local translocation between trawls mixed with longer-range translocation increases realised input. The trawler can change its translocation strategy in the light of information about recent trawling success compared to its long-term average but, in contrast to predictions of the Marginal Value Theorem (MVT) model, does not know for certain what it will find by moving, so may need to sample new patches. The combination of the two types of translocation mirrored beam-trawling strategies used by the Dutch fleet and the resultant distribution of trawling effort is confirmed by analysis of historical effort distribution of British otter trawling fleets in the North Sea. Fisheries exploitation represents an area where dynamic agent-based adaptive models may be a better representation of the economic dynamics of a fleet than classically inspired optimisation models.},

We constructed a spatially-explicit simulation model to explore how predator and prey behavioral traits and patterns of resource distribution influence spatial overlap between predators, prey, and prey resources. Predator and prey spatial association primarily followed the ideal free distribution. Departures from this model were intriguing, especially from the interactions of predator and prey behavior. When prey weakly avoided conspecifics, they associated more highly with resources when predators were present. Predators increased the rate of prey movement between patches, which increased their ability to sample their environment and aggregate in patches with high resources. When prey strongly avoided each other, predators decreased prey association with resources. That is, an increased rate of prey movement increased the probability that prey would interact and avoid each other without regard to the distribution of resources. More generally, a more highly clumped distribution of resources acted as a spatial anchor that generally increased prey, predator, and resource association. Prey tended to congregate with resources and predators generally congregated with prey.},

  abstract = {(1) The theoretical distribution of non-omniscient predators in a heterogeneous multi-patch environment is studied by numerical simulation. Although various relative densities are explored, we mostly attend to environments where prey density is approximately one order of magnitude higher than predator density. (2) Predators are assumed to follow the rule of abandoning their current patch when local capture rate is lower than estimated capture rate in the environment as a whole. This rule was chosen because it is known to maximize long-term capture rate in many foraging situations. For convenience, we assume that after abandoning a patch, predators arrive at random at any patch in the environment. (3) Predators detect precisely the capture rate in their current patch but `learn' about the environmental average. Learning is simulated using a linear operator model which estimates global capture rate as a weighted average of past and current experienced capture rate. Following a common approach is psychological models of simple learning, the relative weight of past and present capture rate is controlled by a parameter denominated the `memory factor'. (4) In the absence of depletion, the predators distribute themselves close to the predictions of the Ideal Free Distribution model. This result indicates that the IFD prediction is not dependent on assuming omniscient predation, but instead can be jointly derived from reasonable assumptions about learning and optimal foraging at individual level. (5) When the environment depletes as a consequence of predation, cumulative prey mortality can be positively or negatively density-dependent, depending on the interaction between predator efficiency and the velocity of the learning process as determined by the memory factor. (6) The learning model converges towards the IFD faster than `omniscient' variants in which the predators, instead of using a learned estimate and migrating `blindly' to any patch, use the true environmental average for the migration decision and migrate only to patches with capture rate higher than their current capture rate. (7) Both spatial and temporal between-patch variance in prey density affect the behaviour of our model.}

  abstract = {(1) We investigate properties of a model of predator distribution in relation to prey abundance, when the predation process is subject to: (i) non-negligible handling time and mutual interference; (ii) predator learning; (iii) intake rate maximization by individual predators. The model is a development of that of Bernstein, Kacelnik \& Krebs (1988). (2) The independent variables are between-patch travel cost and structure of the environment. The outcome of the model is described in relation to the predictions of the ideal free distribution (IFD). We consider both the numerical distribution of predators and the mortality rate imposed on the prey population. (3) When travel cost is small, prey depletion is slow and interference is moderate, predators conform to the predictions of the IFD and prey mortality is density-dependent. (4) As travel cost is increased, rate-maximizing predators become more sedentary and the population settles at distributions far from the IFD. In common with all other disturbances of the predation process that impair the correlation between prey and predator densities, this causes mortality to approach density independence and later negative density dependence. (5) In semi-continuous environments where prey density is correlated between neighbouring patches, the slower the spatial rate of variation in prey density (the coarser the environmental grain), the poorer is the adjustment to the IFD. This effect is due to the predators' need for learning: when the environmental sample experienced within the reach of each individual predator is unrepresentative of the global average prey density (as it happens when the environmental grain is very coarse relative to migration range of predators), the predators cannot learn the global distribution of foraging opportunities and fail to take the policy that optimizes individual intake rate. (6) We discuss how these findings might account for observed patterns of mortality in real insects populations.},

Therefore, if these sources of variation are removed, individuals are predicted to develop similar phenotypes lacking repeatable individual variation. Moreover, even among genetically identical individuals, direct social interactions are predicted to be a powerful factor shaping the development of individuality. We use tightly controlled ontogenetic experiments with clonal fish, the Amazon molly (Poecilia formosa), to test whether near-identical rearing conditions and lack of social contact dampen individuality. In sharp contrast to our predictions, we find that (i) substantial individual variation in behaviour emerges among genetically identical individuals isolated directly after birth into highly standardized environments and (ii) increasing levels of social experience during ontogeny do not affect levels of individual behavioural variation. In contrast to the current research paradigm, which focuses on genes and/or environmental drivers, our findings suggest that individuality might be an inevitable and potentially unpredictable outcome of development.},

  abstract = {Social foraging is common and may provide benefits of safety and public information. Public information permits faster and more accurate estimates of patch resource densities, thus allowing more effective foraging. In this paper we report on two experiments with red knots Calidris canutus, socially foraging shorebirds that eat bivalves on intertidal mudflats. The first experiment was designed to show that red knots are capable of using public information, and whether dominance status or sex affected its use. We showed that knots can detect the foraging success of conspecifics and choose a patch accordingly. Neither dominance status nor sex influenced public information use. In the second experiment, by manipulating group size, we investigated whether public information use affected food-patch discovery rates and patch residence times. We showed that the time needed before locating a food patch decreased in proportion to group size. Also, an individual's number of patch visits before locating the food declined with group size, and, to our surprise, their average patch residence time did as well. Moreover, knots differed in their search strategy in that some birds consistently exploited the searching efforts of others. We conclude that socially foraging knots have the potential to greatly increase their food-finding rate by using public information.

  abstract = {The various meanings of "competition" in ecology, genetics and evolution are grouped into four main meanings which differ in important respects from each other. They grade from a strict meaning to one so broad as to be synonymous with natural selection. In the strict sense competition between animals occurs when a number of animals (of the same or of different species) utilize common resources the supply of which is short; or if the resources are not in short supply competition occurs when the animals seeking that resource nevertheless harm one or another in the process. Intermediate between the strict and the broad meanings are two others. One includes any interference of one species by another irrespective of whether they use common resources or not, and the other includes predation within the meaning of competition. Each of the four meanings of competition is illustrated with examples. A distinction is made between the influence of one species on the numbers of another and the influence of one genotype on the frequency of another genotype of the same species. In the former case one species can influence the frequency of another by competition only when there is a shortage of some resource. The one exception is some special cases of threat. The conclusion is drawn that if the term competition is retained in biological writings it should be restricted to the one strict meaning defined above. On the other hand this may be an appropriate time for approaching the problems of how one organism influences the numbers of another in a fresh way without recourse to the concept of competition at all.},

  abstract = {A simple argument based on the distribution of individuals amongst discrete resource sites is used to show how the form of single species population models depends on the type of competition between, and the spatial clustering of, the individuals. For scramble competition between individuals, we confirm earlier demonstrations that the Ricker model is a direct consequence of a uniform random distribution of individuals across resources. By introducing spatial clustering of individuals according to a negative binomial distribution, we are able to derive the Hassell model. Furthermore, the tent map model is seen to be a consequence of scramble competition and an ideal-free distribution of individuals. To model contest competition under different degrees of spatial clustering we derive a new three-parameter model, of which the Beverton–Holt and Skellam models are special cases, where one of the parameters relates directly to the clustering distribution. Other population models, such as the quadratic model and the theta-Ricker models, cannot be derived in our framework. Taken together our derivations of population models allows us to make a more rigorous prescription for model choice when fitting to particular datasets.},

We identify three mechanisms whereby limited dispersal of hosts and parasitoids combined with other features, such as spatial and temporal heterogeneity, can promote increased persistence and stability. The first mechanism, “statistical stabilization”, is simply the statistical effect that summing a number of out-of-phase population trajectories results in a relatively constant total population density. The second mechanism involves decoupling of immigration from local density, such that limited dispersal between asynchronous patches results in an effect that mimics density-dependence at the local patch level. The third mechanism involves altering spatially averaged parameter values resulting from spatial heterogeneity in density combined with non-linear responses to density. Persistence in spatially explicit models with local dispersal is frequently associated with self-organized spatial patterning.},

  abstract = {A technique for using patch giving up densities to investigate habitat preferences, predation risk, and interspecific competitive relationships is theoretically analyzed and empirically investigated. Giving up densities, the density of resources within a patch at which an individual ceases foraging, provide considerably more information than simply the amount of resources harvested. The giving up density of a forager, which is behaving optimally, should correspond to a harvest rate that just balances the metabolic costs of foraging, the predation cost of foraging, and the missed opportunity cost of not engaging in alternative activities. In addition, changes in giving up densities in response to climatic factors, predation risk, and missed opportunities can be used to test the model and to examine the consistency of the foragers' behavior. The technique was applied to a community of four Arizonan granivorous rodents (Perognathus amplus, Dipodomys merriami, Ammospermophilus harrisii, and Spermophilus tereticaudus). Aluminum trays filled with 3 grams of millet seeds mixed into 3 liters of sifted soil provided resource patches. The seeds remaining following a night or day of foraging were used to determine the giving up density, and footprints in the sifted sand indicated the identity of the forager. Giving up densities consistently differed in response to forager species, microhabitat (bush versus open), data, and station. The data also provide useful information regarding the relative foraging efficiencies and microhabitat preferences of the coexisting rodent species.},

The five mechanisms, based on foraging theory, considered various forms of habitat selection in time and space. From November 1986 until January 1988, we live—trapped to census rodent populations, counted rodent spoor in tracking plots to quantify activity, and measured the rodents' giving—up densities (GUDs: the amount of food remaining within a resource patch following exploitation by a forager) in seed trays to determine relative foraging efficiencies. The population sizes of the two gerbil species tended to fluctuate synchronously (unfortunately, we could not live—trap any jerboas). G. allenbyi biased its activity towards the stabilized sand habitat and towards the bush microhabitat. In contrast, G. pyramidum and J. jaculus biased their activity towards semistabilized sand habitats, and J. jaculus also biased its activity towards the open microhabitat. Despite divergent patterns of habitat use among species, G. allenbyi tended to be the most efficient forager and J. jaculus the least efficient forager regardless of microhabitat, sand habitat, or month. G. allenbyi's presence in the community may be assured by its higher foraging efficiency. J. jaculus's presence in the community may either result from its ability to travel greater distances and utilize rare, rich resource patches, or result from an herbivorous diet. G. pyramidum's presence with G. allenbyi in the community appears to require the less stabilized sand habitats and the ability of G. pyramidum to dominate rich patches by interference or nightly temporal partitioning.},

  abstract = {Mammalian predator-prey systems are behaviorally sophisticated games of stealth and fear. But, traditional mass-action models of predator prey dynamics treat individuals as behaviorally unresponsive “molecules” in Brownian motion. Foraging theory should provide the conceptual framework to envision the interaction. But, current models of predator feeding behavior generally envision a clever predator consuming large numbers of sessile and behaviorally inert prey (e.g., kangaroo rats, Dipodomys, collecting seeds from food patches). Here, we extend foraging theory to consider a predator-prey game of stealth and fear and then embed this game into the modeling of predator-prey population dynamics. The melding of the prey and predator's optimal behaviors with their population and community-level consequences constitutes the ecology of fear. The ecology of fear identifies the endpoints of a continuum of N-driven (population size) versus μ-driven (fear) systems. In N-driven systems, the major direct dynamical feedback involves predators killing prey, whereas μ-driven systems involve the indirect effects from changes in fear levels and prey catchability. In μ-driven systems, prey respond to predators by becoming more vigilant or by moving away from suspected predators. In this way, a predator (e.g., mountain lion, Puma concolor) depletes a food patch (e.g., local herd of mule deer, Odocoileus hemionus) by frightening prey rather than by actually killing prey. Behavior buffers the system: a reduction in predator numbers should rapidly engender less vigilant and more catchable prey. The ecology of fear explains why big fierce carnivores should be and can be rare. In carnivore systems, ignore the behavioral game at one's peril.},

  abstract = {1 Type II functional responses, which can be described by Holling’s disc equation, have been found in many studies of predator/prey and host/parasite interactions. However, an increasing number of studies have shown that the assumptions on which the disc equation is based do not necessarily hold. We examine the functional response of kleptoparasitically feeding Arctic skuas (Stercorarius parasiticus L.) to the abundance of fish-carrying auks and, by examination of the assumptions of the disc equation, test whether it can explain the function. 2 The rate at which individual skuas make successful chases is a decelerating function of the abundance of auks. However, it would appear that this is not determined by factors that influence their probability of success, but by the rate at which they initiate chases. This too is a decelerating function of the abundance of auks. Arctic skuas have a Type II functional response. 3 Although Arctic skuas exhibited a direct numerical response there was no evidence that components of predation connected to the density of predators (direct prey stealing, or increased host avoidance) had any effect on the rate at which individual skuas made chases or were successful in their chases. We conclude that the observed functional response is free from any effects of interference. 4 We suggest that abnormally high levels of foraging effort expended by breeding skuas and their poor breeding success in the years of observation argue against the limit to the observed functional response being determined by skuas’ energetic requirements. 5 Several of the assumptions underlying the disc equation do not hold. The duration of chases (handling time) was not a constant; it decreased with increasing host abundance. Moreover, the chase duration predicted by the disc equation, if handling time limited the functional response, was far in excess of that observed. Furthermore, the observed rate of decline in the searching time per victim with increasing host abundance suggested that skuas’ instantaneous rate of discovery was also not constant. Possible reasons for these observations are discussed. The basic disc equation may describe Arctic skuas’ functional response, but it cannot explain it.},

  abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity in decision making should be selected for when reliable information on current conditions is available. When current information is unreliable, however, selection should favour unresponsive behavioural phenotypes, which might lead to the emergence of personalities. We tested the hypothesis that personality will affect decision making when information is unreliable, but not when it is reliable. We measured two personality traits, boldness and anxiety, in 55 wild chacma baboons, Papio ursinus, by quantifying responses to a novel food and a mild threat, respectively, in repeated field experiments. To assess decision making under different information reliabilities, we recorded foraging decisions in two contexts. We followed the baboons as they foraged naturally with reliable information about their environment ({$>$}8900 decisions) and, to manipulate information reliability experimentally, we performed a large-scale in situ foraging experiment during which we provided the study troops with access to experimental food patches ({$>$}10\hphantom{,}000 decisions). Importantly, the baboons could not see the food in the experimental patches until close inspection of them, and thus had unreliable information about patch quality. We found plastic foraging decisions in the presence of reliable cues, but personality-dependent decisions in the absence of such cues. Specifically, bold individuals were more likely to produce, and shy individuals scrounge, in the experimental arena but there was no effect of personality on foraging decisions under natural foraging conditions. Our results clarify the importance of information reliability in the evolution of personality and plasticity. These findings also contribute to our understanding of how individuals, and thus populations, might respond to environmental change in the future.},

The interfering species realizes a “profit” if some resources, which the species interfered against would have utilized, are made available as a result of the interference. Interference is favored when its cost is small, its effect is high, and the resource overlap with the species interfered against is high. Interference is likely to be an alternative strategy to high exploitation efficiency. The incorporation of interference into niche theory clarifies the competitive phenomenon of unstable equilibrium points, excess density compensation on islands, competitive avoidance by escape in time and space, the persistence of the “prudent predator,” and the magnitude of the difference between the size of a species' fundamental niche and its realized niche.},

  abstract = {The relative contribution of personal and social information to explain individual and collective behavior in different species and contexts is an open question in animal ecology. In particular, there is a major lack of studies combining theoretical and empirical approaches to test the relative relevance of different hypothesized individual behaviors to predict empirical collective patterns. We used an individual-based model to confront three hypotheses about the information transfer between social scavengers (Griffon Vultures, Gyps fulvus) when searching for carrion: (1) Vultures only use personal information during foraging (“nonsocial” hypothesis); (2) they create long chains of vultures by following both other vultures that are flying towards carcasses and vultures that are following other vultures that are flying towards carcasses (“chains of vultures” hypothesis); and (3) vultures are only attracted by other vultures that are sinking vertically to a carcass (“local enhancement” hypothesis). The chains of vultures hypothesis has been used in existing models, but never been confronted with field data. Testing is important, though, because these hypotheses could have different management implications. The model was parameterized to mimic the behavior and the densities of both Griffon Vultures and carcasses in a 10 000-km2 study area in northeastern Spain. We compared the number of vultures attending simulated carcasses with those attending 25 continuously monitored experimental carcasses in the field. Social hypotheses outperformed the nonsocial hypothesis. The chains of vultures hypothesis overestimated the number of vultures feeding on carcasses; the local enhancement hypothesis fitted closely to the empirical data. Supported by our results, we discuss mechanistic and adaptive considerations that reveal that local enhancement may be the key social mechanism behind collective foraging in this and likely other avian scavengers and/or social birds. It also highlights the current need for more studies confronting alternative models of key behaviors with empirical patterns in order to understand how collective behavior emerges in animal societies.},

The two   populations move randomly and increase logistically, with birth rates   determined by the amount of resource acquired. Producers can obtain the   resource directly from the environment, but must surrender a proportion of   their discoveries to nearby scroungers through a process known as scramble   kleptoparasitism. The proportion of resources stolen by a scrounger from   nearby producers decreases as the local scrounger density increases.   Parameter combinations which allow producers and scroungers to persist   either alone or together are distinguished from those in which they cannot.   Producer persistence depends in general on the distribution of resources and   producer movement, whereas scrounger persistence depends on its ability to   invade when producers are at steady-state. It is found that (i) both species   can persist when the habitat has high productivity, (ii) neither species can   persist when the habitat has low productivity, and (iii) slower dispersal of   both the producer and scrounger is favored when the habitat has intermediate   productivity.},

These models do not exclude migration at the IFD where balanced dispersal emerges. It is shown that the population distribution converges to the IFD even when animals are nonideal (i.e., they do not know the quality of all patches). In particular, the IFD emerges when animals never migrate from patches with a higher payoff to patches with a lower payoff and when some animals always migrate to the best patch. It is shown that some random migration does not necessarily lead to undermatching, provided migration occurs at the IFD. The effect of population dynamics on the IFD (and vice versa) is analyzed. Without any migration, it is shown that population dynamics alone drive the population distribution to the IFD. If animal migration tends (for each fixed population size) to the IFD, then the combined migration‐population dynamics evolve to the population IFD independent of the two timescales (i.e., behavioral vs. population).},

It is shown that the optimal foraging behavior that maximizes predator energy intake per unit time is a Nash equilibrium of the underlying optimal foraging game. We apply these game-theoretical methods to three scenarios: the classical diet choice model with two types of prey and sequential prey encounters, the diet choice model with simultaneous prey encounters, and a model in which the predator requires a positive recognition time to identify the type of prey encountered. For both diet choice models, it is shown that every Nash equilibrium yields optimal foraging behavior. Although suboptimal Nash equilibrium outcomes may exist when prey recognition time is included, only optimal foraging behavior is stable under evolutionary learning processes.},

  abstract = {Agent-based modelling (ABM) is becoming the dominant paradigm in social simulation due primarily to a worldview that suggests that complex systems emerge from the bottom-up, are highly decentralised, and are composed of a multitude of heterogeneous objects called agents. These agents act with some purpose and their interaction, usually through time and space, generates emergent order, often at higher levels than those at which such agents operate. ABM however raises as many challenges as it seeks to resolve. It is the purpose of this paper to catalogue these challenges and to illustrate them using three somewhat different agent-based models applied to city systems. The seven challenges we pose involve: the purpose for which the model is built, the extent to which the model is rooted in independent theory, the extent to which the model can be replicated, the ways the model might be verified, calibrated and validated, the way model dynamics are represented in terms of agent interactions, the extent to which the model is operational, and the way the model can be communicated and shared with others. Once catalogued, we then illustrate these challenges with a pedestrian model for emergency evacuation in central London, a hypothetical model of residential segregation model tuned to London data, and an agent-based residential location model, for Greater London. The ambiguities posed by this new style of modelling are drawn out as conclusions, and the relative arbitrariness of such modelling highlighted.},

However, lag times for the detection of such leading indicators are typically long. Here, we show that increased spatial correlation may serve as a more powerful early-warning signal in systems consisting of many coupled units. We first show why from the universal phenomenon of critical slowing down, spatial correlation should be expected to increase in the vicinity of bifurcations. Subsequently, we explore the applicability of this idea in spatially explicit ecosystem models that can have alternative attractors. The analysis reveals that as a control parameter slowly pushes the system towards the threshold, spatial correlation between neighboring cells tends to increase well before the transition. We show that such increase in spatial correlation represents a better early-warning signal than indicators derived from time-series provided that there is sufficient spatial heterogeneity and connectivity in the system.},

  abstract = {Predicting the risk of critical transitions, such as the collapse of a population, is important in order to direct management efforts. In any system that is close to a critical transition, recovery upon small perturbations becomes slow, a phenomenon known as critical slowing down. It has been suggested that such slowing down may be detected indirectly through an increase in spatial and temporal correlation and variance. Here, we tested this idea in arid ecosystems, where vegetation may collapse to desert as a result of increasing water limitation. We used three models that describe desertification but differ in the spatial vegetation patterns they produce. In all models, recovery rate upon perturbation decreased before vegetation collapsed. However, in one of the models, slowing down failed to translate into rising variance and correlation. This is caused by the regular self-organized vegetation patterns produced by this model. This finding implies an important limitation of variance and correlation as indicators of critical transitions. However, changes in such self-organized patterns themselves are a reliable indicator of an upcoming transition. Our results illustrate that while critical slowing down may be a universal phenomenon at critical transitions, its detection through indirect indicators may have limitations in particular systems.},

  abstract = {Many dynamical systems, including lakes, organisms, ocean circulation patterns, or financial markets, are now thought to have tipping points where critical transitions to a contrasting state can happen. Because critical transitions can occur unexpectedly and are difficult to manage, there is a need for methods that can be used to identify when a critical transition is approaching. Recent theory shows that we can identify the proximity of a system to a critical transition using a variety of so-called ‘early warning signals’, and successful empirical examples suggest a potential for practical applicability. However, while the range of proposed methods for predicting critical transitions is rapidly expanding, opinions on their practical use differ widely, and there is no comparative study that tests the limitations of the different methods to identify approaching critical transitions using time-series data. Here, we summarize a range of currently available early warning methods and apply them to two simulated time series that are typical of systems undergoing a critical transition. In addition to a methodological guide, our work offers a practical toolbox that may be used in a wide range of fields to help detect early warning signals of critical transitions in time series data.},

Inclusion of such variation is important for continued progress in ecological and evolutionary theory. We provide a conceptual basis for IBMs by describing five major types of individual variation in IBMs: spatial, ontogenetic, phenotypic, cognitive, and genetic. IBMs are now used in almost all subfields of ecology and evolutionary biology. We map those subfields and look more closely at selected key papers on fish recruitment, forest dynamics, sympatric speciation, metapopulation dynamics, maintenance of diversity, and species conservation. Theorists are currently divided on whether IBMs represent only a practical tool for extending classical theory to more complex situations, or whether individual-based theory represents a radically new research program. We feel that the tension between these two poles of thinking can be a source of creativity in ecology and evolutionary theory.},

  abstract = {All basic processes of ecological populations involve decisions; when and where to move, when and what to eat, and whether to fight or flee. Yet decisions and the underlying principles of decision-making have been difficult to integrate into the classical population-level models of ecology. Certainly, there is a long history of modeling individuals’ searching behavior, diet selection, or conflict dynamics within social interactions. When all individuals are given certain simple rules to govern their decision-making processes, the resultant population–level models have yielded important generalizations and theory. But it is also recognized that such models do not represent the way real individuals decide on actions. Factors that influence a decision include the organism’s environment with its dynamic rewards and risks, the complex internal state of the organism, and its imperfect knowledge of the environment. In the case of animals, it may also involve complex social factors, and experience and learning, which vary among individuals. The way that all factors are weighed and processed to lead to decisions is a major area of behavioral theory. While classic population-level modeling is limited in its ability to integrate decision-making in its actual complexity, the development of individual- or agent-based models (IBM/ABMs) (we use ABM throughout to designate both ‘agent-based modeling’ and an ‘agent-based model’) has opened the possibility of describing the way that decisions are made, and their effects, in minute detail. Over the years, these models have increased in size and complexity. Current ABMs can simulate thousands of individuals in realistic environments, and with highly detailed internal physiology, perception and ability to process the perceptions and make decisions based on those and their internal states. The implementation of decision-making in ABMs ranges from fairly simple to highly complex; the process of an individual deciding on an action can occur through the use of logical and simple (if-then) rules to more sophisticated neural networks and genetic algorithms. The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of the ways in which decisions are integrated into a variety of ABMs and to give a prospectus on the future of modeling of decisions in ABMs.},

Focusing solely on efficiency, however, ignores the fact that animal activity can affect resource availability and distribution. Here, we show that feedback between individual behavior and environmental complexity can explain movement strategies in mussels. Specifically, experiments show that mussels use a Lévy walk during the formation of spatially patterned beds, and models reveal that this Lévy movement accelerates pattern formation. The emergent patterning in mussel beds, in turn, improves individual fitness. These results suggest that Lévy walks evolved as a result of the selective advantage conferred by autonomously generated, emergent spatial patterns in mussel beds. Our results emphasize that an interaction between individual selection and habitat complexity shapes animal movement in natural systems. Animals’ movements may not only respond to the environment, but may also shape it, and thus affect fitness. Animals’ movements may not only respond to the environment, but may also shape it, and thus affect fitness.},

  abstract = {Cooperation, ubiquitous in nature, is difficult to explain from an evolutionary perspective. Many modelling studies strive to resolve this challenge, but their simplifying assumptions on population and interaction structure are rarely met in ecological settings. Here we use a modelling approach that includes more ecological detail to investigate evolution of cooperation in spatially self-organized mussel beds. Mussels cooperate with each other through aggregative movement and attachment using byssal threads. These cooperative behaviours shape the spatial structure of the mussel bed, which can range from scattered distributions to labyrinth-like patterns and dense mussel clumps. The spatial pattern in turn impacts an individual’s fitness at two levels: (i) proper attachment to neighbouring individuals decreases predation risk, and (ii) attachment to a sufficiently large group prevents dislodgement by wave stress. Without this second level of selection, our simulations do typically not result in evolutionary attractors that lead to the labyrinth-like spatial patterns that are characteristic for natural mussel beds. Yet, when group-level selection is included, labyrinth-like patterns emerge under a wide range of conditions. Our model demonstrates that multiple selection factors working at different spatial scales – predation of individuals and dislodgement of entire mussel clumps – combinedly determine evolution of cooperative traits in mussels and thereby result in emergence of the labyrinth-like spatial patterns that we observe in natural mussel beds.},

  abstract = {African elephants (Loxodonta africana) are well-studied and inhabit diverse landscapes that are being transformed by both humans and natural forces. Most tools currently in use are limited in their ability to predict how elephants will respond to novel changes in the environment. Individual-, or agent-based modeling (ABM), may extend current methods in addressing and predicting spatial responses to environmental conditions over time. We developed a spatially explicit agent-based model to simulate elephant space use and validated the model with movement data from elephants in Kruger National Park (KNP) and Chobe National Park (CNP). We simulated movement at an hourly scale, as this scale can reflect switches in elephant behavior due to changes in internal states and short-term responses to the local availability and distribution of critical resources, including forage, water, and shade. Known internal drivers of elephant movement, including perceived temperature and the time since an individual last visited a water source, were linked to the external environment through behavior-based movement rules. Simulations were run on model landscapes representing the wet season and the hot, dry season for both parks. The model outputs, including home range size, daily displacement distance, net displacement distance, and maximum distance traveled from a permanent water source, were evaluated through qualitative and quantitative comparisons to actual elephant movement data from both KNP and CNP. The ABM was successful in reproducing the differences in daily displacements between seasons in each park, and in distances traveled from a permanent water source between parks and seasons. Other movement characteristics, including differences in home range sizes and net daily displacements, were partially reproduced. Out of the all the statistical comparisons made between the empirical and simulated movement patterns, the majority were classified as discrepancies of medium or small effect size. We have shown that a resource-driven model with relatively simple decision rules generates trajectories with movement characteristics that are mostly comparable to those calculated from empirical data. Simulating hourly movement (as our model does) may be useful in predicting how finer-scale patterns of space use, such as those created by foraging movements, are influenced by finer spatio-temporal changes in the environment.},

However, its predictions do not always match observed distributions of foraging animals. Instead, we often observe that there are more consumers than predicted in low-quality patches and fewer consumers than predicted in high-quality patches (i.e. undermatching). We examine the possibility that animal personality is one explanation for this undermatching. We first conducted a literature search to determine how commonly studies document the personality distribution of populations. Second, we created a simple individual-based model to conceptually demonstrate why knowing the distribution of personalities is important for studies of populations of foragers in context of the IFD. Third, we present a specific example where we calculate the added time to reach the IFD for a population of mud crabs that has a considerable number of individuals with relatively inactive personalities. We suggest that animal personality, particularly the prevalence of inactive personality types, may inhibit the ability of a population to track changes in habitat quality, therefore leading to undermatching of the IFD. This may weaken the IFD as a predictive model moving forward.},

  abstract = {Behaviors can facilitate colonization of a novel environment, but the mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. On one hand, behavioral flexibility allows for an immediate response of colonizers to novel environments, which is critical to population establishment and persistence. On the other hand, integrated sets of behaviors that display limited flexibility can enhance invasion success by coupling behaviors with dispersal strategies that are especially important during natural range expansions. Direct observations of colonization events are required to determine the mechanisms underlying changes in behavior associated with colonization, but such observations are rare. Here, we studied changes in aggression on a large temporal and spatial scale across populations of two sister taxa of bluebirds (Sialia) to show that coupling of aggression and dispersal strongly facilitated the range expansion of western bluebirds across the northwestern United States over the last 30 years. We show that biased dispersal of highly aggressive males to the invasion front allowed western bluebirds to displace less aggressive mountain bluebirds. However, once mountain bluebirds were excluded, aggression of western bluebirds decreased rapidly across consecutive generations in concordance with local selection on highly heritable aggressive behavior. Further, the observed adaptive microevolution of aggression was accelerated by the link between dispersal propensity and aggression. Importantly, our results show that behavioral changes among populations were not caused by behavioral flexibility and instead strongly implicate adaptive integration of dispersal and aggression in facilitating the ongoing and rapid reciprocal range change of these species in North America.},

It is suggested, on the basis of this model, that: 1) Food preferences can be adequately described only if a number of factors other than relative frequencies in the diet and relative abundances of the food types are known. 2) Animals should be more selective in their choice of foods when satiated or when food is common, more indiscriminate when starved or when food is scarce. 3) Animals may eat one food type with greater frequency, relative to its abundance, than another even if the other food is richer and more efficiently exploited. This occurs in situations of high relative abundance of the first food type. 4) The extent to which predators tend to pass by potential food items may be used to evaluate the role of food in the population limitation of a predator species. 5) Food preferences appear to change readily and appropriately to changes in the environment. preferences a stable equilibrium tends to become established.

  abstract = {Habitat-selection analyses allow researchers to link animals to their environment via habitat-selection or step-selection functions, and are commonly used to address questions related to wildlife management and conservation efforts. Habitat-selection analyses that incorporate movement characteristics, referred to as integrated step-selection analyses, are particularly appealing because they allow modelling of both movement and habitat-selection processes. Despite their popularity, many users struggle with interpreting parameters in habitat-selection and step-selection functions. Integrated step-selection analyses also require several additional steps to translate model parameters into a full-fledged movement model, and the mathematics supporting this approach can be challenging for many to understand. Using simple examples, we demonstrate how weighted distribution theory and the inhomogeneous Poisson point process can facilitate parameter interpretation in habitat-selection analyses. Furthermore, we provide a ‘how to’ guide illustrating the steps required to implement integrated step-selection analyses using the amt package By providing clear examples with open-source code, we hope to make habitat-selection analyses more understandable and accessible to end users.},

  abstract = {Quantifying animals' home ranges is a key problem in ecology and has important conservation and wildlife management applications. Kernel density estimation (KDE) is a workhorse technique for range delineation problems that is both statistically efficient and nonparametric. KDE assumes that the data are independent and identically distributed (IID). However, animal tracking data, which are routinely used as inputs to KDEs, are inherently autocorrelated and violate this key assumption. As we demonstrate, using realistically autocorrelated data in conventional KDEs results in grossly underestimated home ranges. We further show that the performance of conventional KDEs actually degrades as data quality improves, because autocorrelation strength increases as movement paths become more finely resolved. To remedy these flaws with the traditional KDE method, we derive an autocorrelated KDE (AKDE) from first principles to use autocorrelated data, making it perfectly suited for movement data sets. We illustrate the vastly improved performance of AKDE using analytical arguments, relocation data from Mongolian gazelles, and simulations based upon the gazelle's observed movement process. By yielding better minimum area estimates for threatened wildlife populations, we believe that future widespread use of AKDE will have significant impact on ecology and conservation biology.},

  abstract = {1. Habitat selection models usually assume that the spatial distributions of animals depend positively on the distributions of resources and negatively on interference. However, the presence of conspecifics at a given location also signals safety and the availability of resources. This may induce followers to select contiguous patches and causes animals to cluster. Resource availability, interference and attraction therefore jointly lead to self-organized patterns in foraging animals. 2. We analyse the distribution of foraging shorebirds at landscape level on the basis of a resource-based model to establish, albeit indirectly, the importance of conspecific attraction and interference. 3. At 23 intertidal sites with a mean area of 170 ha spread out over the Dutch Wadden Sea, the spatial distribution of six abundant shorebird species was determined. The location of individuals and groups was mapped using a simple method based on projective geometry, enabling fast mapping of low-tide foraging shorebird distributions. We analysed the suitability of these 23 sites in terms of food availability and travel distances to high tide roosts. 4. We introduce an interference sensitivity scale which maps interference as a function of inter-individual distance. We thus obtain interference-insensitive species, which are only sensitive to interference at short inter-individual distances (and may thus pack densely) and interference-sensitive species which interfere over greater inter-individual distances (and thus form sparse flocks). 5. We found that interference-insensitive species like red knot (Calidris canutus) and dunlins (Calidris alpina) are more clustered than predicted by the spatial distribution of their food resources. This suggests that these species follow each other when selecting foraging patches. In contrast, curlew (Numenius arquata) and grey plover (Pluvialis squatarola), known to be sensitive to interference, form sparse flocks. Hence, resource-based models have better predictive power for interference-sensitive species than for interference-insensitive species. 6. It follows from our analysis that monitoring programmes, habitat selection models and statistical analyses should also consider the mechanisms of self-organization.},

In this paper we integrate a classical functional response model based on resource availability and interference with a conspecific attraction model and use it to simulate spatial distributions of animals in their continuous resource landscapes. We consider both equilibrium and non-equilibrium distributions. We show that the integrated model produces distributions of foraging animals that closely match the distributions observed in nature. The simulations also show that under information uncertainty the locations of flocks are highly variable when conspecific attraction is strong. We furthermore explain how we can estimate the impacts of conspecific attraction and interference on the distribution of foraging animals by spatial autoregression. On the basis of simulated data we show that the separate impacts of interference and conspecific attraction can be disentangled when prior information on either is available, in addition to information on resource density and predator density, and that the total food effect is given by the spatial multiplier.},

  abstract = {Reproductive success and habitat preference are generally assumed to be negatively associated with densities of con- and heterospecific competitors. However, recent theoretical studies have suggested that in some cases habitat preference may have a nonlinear unimodal function in relation to con- or heterospecific competitor densities – intermediate densities being preferred. Such a pattern is expected if con- or heterospecific densities are used as a proximate cue in habitat selection, which may produce benefits by reducing searching costs and providing information about current habitat quality and costs of competition. At low density the use of such cues, and hence habitat selection, are hampered, whereas at high density costs of competition exceed the benefits of using cues, leading to avoidance. Here, we tested this hypothesis by examining whether arboreal migratory birds use the density of resident titmice (Parus spp.) in habitat selection decisions. Many migrants and titmice species share similar resource needs making titmice density a reliable source of information for migrants. At the scale of habitat patches, we experimentally created a range of titmice densities from low to very high and subsequently measured the density response of migrants. In contrast to the unimodal habitat preference hypothesis, the average species number and total density of migratory birds were positively and linearly correlated with manipulated titmice density. Thus, migrants probably use titmice density as a relative indicator of habitat quality (abundance or quality of food) because foliage gleaners that share similar food resource with titmice, but not ground foragers, showed a positive association with manipulated titmice density. These results emphasize the positive effect of interspecific social information on habitat choice decisions and diversity of migratory bird community.},

  abstract = {A trophic cascade recently has been reported among wolves, elk, and aspen on the northern winter range of Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA, but the mechanisms of indirect interactions within this food chain have yet to be established. We investigated whether the observed trophic cascade might have a behavioral basis by exploring environmental factors influencing the movements of 13 female elk equipped with GPS radio collars. We developed a simple statistical approach that can unveil the concurrent influence of several environmental features on animal movements. Paths of elk traveling on their winter range were broken down into steps, which correspond to the straight-line segment between successive locations at 5-hour intervals. Each observed step was paired with 200 random steps having the same starting point, but differing in length and/or direction. Comparisons between the characteristics of observed and random steps using conditional logistic regression were used to model environmental features influencing movement patterns. We found that elk movements were influenced by multiple factors, such as the distance from roads, the presence of a steep slope along the step, and the cover type in which they ended. The influence of cover type on elk movements depended on the spatial distribution of wolves across the northern winter range of the park. In low wolf-use areas, the relative preference for end point locations of steps followed: aspen stands {$>$} open areas {$>$} conifer forests. As the risks of wolf encounter increased, the preference of elk for aspen stands gradually decreased, and selection became strongest for steps ending in conifer forests in high wolf-use areas. Our study clarifies the behavioral mechanisms involved in the trophic cascade of Yellowstone's wolf–elk–aspen system: elk respond to wolves on their winter range by a shift in habitat selection, which leads to local reductions in the use of aspen by elk.},

  abstract = {Modelling is often confronted with scaling problems, because modelling—directly or indirectly—always implies scaling. This is because models simplify. Simplification usually means aggregation, and aggregation is a scaling process. As scaling cannot be avoided in modelling, it should carefully be addressed and resolved, at least to the degree possible. In this paper, we give an overview of scaling approaches in ecological modelling. We propose to classify scaling approaches into pre-model scaling, in-model scaling and post-model scaling depending on the timing of the scaling relative to the main modelling process. We show general approaches, examples and potential application problems for each category. We suggest that scaling problems might be more widespread than previously thought. These scaling problems are matched with a range of solutions, but often these solutions will have to be adapted and tailored to the specific scaling case. Thus, we recommend that ecologists be aware of scaling challenges especially where models do not explicitly aim at scaling. Developing general test systems for scaling methods may help to broaden and enhance the application of scaling methods in ecology.},

  abstract = {[1. Individuals in many social species are attracted to feeding conspecifics. The profitability of conspecific attraction is negatively frequency-dependent and can be modelled as a producer-scrounger (PS) game for which the ESS solution predicts some mixture of producer (no attraction) and scrounger (attraction) tactics in the population. Current models for the spatial distribution of rate-maximizing foragers, which learn the quality of habitats as they exploit patches, ignore the possible effect of conspecific attraction on the stable distribution of foragers. 2. We used simulations of a population with ESS levels of attraction to investigate the effect of conspecific attraction on the spatial distribution of learning foragers which incur travel costs. In habitats where patches depleted slowly, ESS levels of attraction helped foragers which experienced no interference reach the expected ideal free distribution (IFD) by facilitating aggregation to the richest patches. Large aggregations also occurred with interference and thus reduced the fit to the IFD, which in this case predicts a scatter of foragers across patches of varying quality. 3. In habitats where patches depleted rapidly, ESS levels of attraction prevented foragers from reaching the IFD, irrespective of interference levels. Foragers failed to learn habitat quality and thus often aggregated in poor patches, especially in large populations which depleted patches faster and had fewer opportunities to learn quality. 4. Predictions of the model in habitats where patches deplete slowly are supported by several studies. More work is needed for habitats where patches deplete more rapidly. We conclude that conspecific attraction can have important, and often disruptive effects on spatial distributions.]},

We characterize the optimal levels of this opportunism in the framework of stochastic models for the two prey-one predator case. We consider the spatial dispersal of preys and the optimal diet choice of predator as well. We show that when both preys have no handling time, the total opportunism provides maximal gain of energy for the predator. When handling times differ with prey, we find a conditional optimal behavior: for small density of both prey species the predator prefers the more valuable one and is entirely opportunistic. However, when the density of the more valuable prey is higher than that of the other species, then the predator prefers the first one and intentionally neglects the other. Furthermore, when the density of the less valuable prey is high and that of the other one is small, then predator will look for the less valuable prey and is therefore totally opportunistic. We demonstrate that prey preference is remunerative whenever the advantage of a proper prey preference is larger than the average cost of missed prey preference. We also propose a dynamics which explicitly contains two sides of shared predation: apparent mutualism and apparent competition, and we give conditions when the rare prey goes extinct.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

We introduce two game-solution concepts. The static solution combines the ideal free distribution of the prey with optimal-foraging theory. The dynamical solution is given by a game dynamics describing the behavioral changes of prey and forager. We show (1) that each stable equilibrium dynamical solution is always a static solution, but not conversely; (2) that at an equilibrium dynamical solution, the forager can stabilize prey mixed patch use strategy in cases where ideal free distribution theory predicts that prey will use only one patch type; and (3) that when the equilibrium dynamical solution is unstable at fixed prey density, stable behavior cycles occur where neither forager nor prey keep a fixed behavior.},

  abstract = {Kleptoparasitism can be considered as a game theoretical problem and a foraging tactic at the same time, so the aim of this paper is to combine the basic ideas of two research lines: evolutionary game theory and optimal foraging theory. To unify these theories, firstly, we take into account the fact that kleptoparasitism between foragers has two consequences: the interaction takes time and affects the net energy intake of both contestants. This phenomenon is modeled by a matrix game under time constraints. Secondly, we also give freedom to each forager to avoid interactions, since in optimal foraging theory foragers can ignore each food type (we have two prey types: either a prey item in possession of another predator or a free prey individual is discovered). The main question of the present paper is whether the zero-one rule of optimal foraging theory (always or never select a prey type) is valid or not, in the case where foragers interact with each other? In our foraging game we consider predators who engage in contests (contestants) and those who never do (avoiders), and in general those who play a mixture of the two strategies. Here the classical zero-one rule does not hold. Firstly, the pure avoider phenotype is never an ESS. Secondly, the pure contestant can be a strict ESS, but we show this is not necessarily so. Thirdly, we give an example when there is mixed ESS.},

  abstract = {Pairwise interactions between species have both direct and indirect consequences that reverberate throughout the whole ecosystem. In particular, interaction effects may propagate in a spatial dimension, to localities connected by organismal movement. Here we study the propagation of interaction effects with a spatially explicit metacommunity model, where local sites are connected by dispersal, foraging, or by both types of movement. We show that indirect pairwise effects are, in most cases, of the same sign as direct effects if localities are connected by dispersing species. However, if foraging is prevalent, this correspondence is broken, and indirect effects between species often have a different sign than direct effects. This highlights the importance of indirect interactions across space and their inherent unpredictability in complex settings with species foraging across local patches. Further, the effect of a species over another in a local patch does not necessarily correspond to its effect at the metacommunity scale; this correspondence is again mediated by the type of movement across localities. Every species, despite their trophic position or spatial range, displays a non-zero net effect over every other species in our model metacommunities. Thus we show that local dynamics and local interactions between species can trigger indirect effects all across the set of connected patches, and these effects have a distinct signature depending on whether the prevalent connection between patches is via dispersal or via foraging. However, the magnitude of this effect between any two species strongly decays with the distance between them. These theoretical results strengthen the importance of considering indirect effects across species at both the community and metacommunity levels, highlight the differences between types of movement across locations, and thus open novel avenues for the study of interaction effects in spatially explicit settings.},

  abstract = {Newly emerging plants provide the best forage for herbivores. To exploit this fleeting resource, migrating herbivores align their movements to surf the wave of spring green-up. With new technology to track migrating animals, the Green Wave Hypothesis has steadily gained empirical support across a diversity of migratory taxa. This hypothesis assumes the green wave is controlled by variation in climate, weather, and topography, and its progression dictates the timing, pace, and extent of migrations. However, aggregate grazers that are also capable of engineering grassland ecosystems make some of the world’s most impressive migrations, and it is unclear how the green wave determines their movements. Here we show that Yellowstone’s bison (Bison bison) do not choreograph their migratory movements to the wave of spring green-up. Instead, bison modify the green wave as they migrate and graze. While most bison surfed during early spring, they eventually slowed and let the green wave pass them by. However, small-scale experiments indicated that feedback from grazing sustained forage quality. Most importantly, a 6-fold decadal shift in bison density revealed that intense grazing caused grasslands to green up faster, more intensely, and for a longer duration. Our finding broadens our understanding of the ways in which animal movements underpin the foraging benefit of migration. The widely accepted Green Wave Hypothesis needs to be revised to include large aggregate grazers that not only move to find forage, but also engineer plant phenology through grazing, thereby shaping their own migratory movements.},

  abstract = {We develop a stochastic, agent-based model to study how genetic traits and experiential changes in the state of agents and available resources influence individuals’ foraging and movement behaviors. These behaviors are manifest as decisions on when to stay and exploit a current resource patch or move to a particular neighboring patch, based on information of the resource qualities of the patches and the anticipated level of intraspecific competition within patches. We use a genetic algorithm approach and an individual’s biomass as a fitness surrogate to explore the foraging strategy diversity of evolving guilds under clonal versus hermaphroditic sexual reproduction. We first present the resource exploitation processes, movement on cellular arrays, and genetic algorithm components of the model. We then discuss their implementation on the Nova software platform. This platform seamlessly combines the dynamical systems modeling of consumer-resource interactions with agent-based modeling of individuals moving over a landscapes, using an architecture that lays transparent the following four hierarchical simulation levels: 1.) within-patch consumer-resource dynamics, 2.) within-generation movement and competition mitigation processes, 3.) across-generation evolutionary processes, and 4.) multiple runs to generate the statistics needed for comparative analyses. The focus of our analysis is on the question of how the biomass production efficiency and the diversity of guilds of foraging strategy types, exploiting resources over a patchy landscape, evolve under clonal versus random hermaphroditic sexual reproduction. Our results indicate greater biomass production efficiency under clonal reproduction only at higher population densities, and demonstrate that polymorphisms evolve and are maintained under random mating systems. The latter result questions the notion that some type of associative mating structure is needed to maintain genetic polymorphisms among individuals exploiting a common patchy resource on an otherwise spatially homogeneous landscape.},

  abstract = {Darwin and the architects of the Modern Synthesis found sympatric speciation difficult to explain and suggested it is unlikely to occur. Increasingly, evidence over the past few decades suggest that sympatric speciation can occur under ecological conditions that require at most intraspecific competition for a structured resource. Here we used an individual-based population model with variable foraging strategies to study the evolution of mating behavior among foraging strategy types. Initially, individuals were placed at random on a structureless resource landscape, with subsequent spatial variation induced through foraging activity itself. The fitness of individuals was determined by their biomass at the end of each generational cycle. The model incorporates three diallelic, codominant foraging strategy genes, and one mate-choice or m-trait (i.e. incipient magic trait) gene, where the latter is inactive when random mating is assumed. Under non-random mating, the m-trait gene promotes increasing levels of either disassortative or assortative mating when the frequency of m respectively increases or decreases from 0.5. Our evolutionary simulations demonstrate that, under initial random mating conditions, an activated m-trait gene evolves to promote assortative mating because the system, in trying to fit a multipeak adaptive landscape, causes heterozygous individuals to be less fit than homozygous individuals. Our results extend our theoretical understanding that sympatric speciation can evolve under nicheless or gradientless resource conditions: i.e. the underlying resource is monomorphic and initially spatially homogeneous. Further the simplicity and generality of our model suggests that sympatric speciation may be more likely than previously thought to occur in mobile, sexually-reproducing organisms.},

  abstract = {Models relating intake rate to food abundance and competitor density (generalized functional response models) can predict forager distributions and movements between patches, but we lack understanding of how distributions and small-scale movements by the foragers themselves affect intake rates. Using a state-of-the-art approach based on continuous-time Markov chain dynamics, we add realism to classic functional response models by acknowledging that the chances to encounter food and competitors are influenced by movement decisions, and, vice versa, that movement decisions are influenced by these encounters. We used a multi-state modelling framework to construct a stochastic functional response model in which foragers alternate between three behavioural states: searching, handling and moving. Using behavioural observations on a molluscivore migrant shorebird (red knot, Calidris canutus canutus), at its main wintering area (Banc d'Arguin, Mauritania), we estimated transition rates between foraging states as a function of conspecific densities and densities of the two main bivalve prey. Intake rate decreased with conspecific density. This interference effect was not due to decreased searching efficiency, but resulted from time lost to avoidance movements. Red knots showed a strong functional response to one prey (Dosinia isocardia), but a weak response to the other prey (Loripes lucinalis). This corroborates predictions from a recently developed optimal diet model that accounts for the mildly toxic effects due to consuming Loripes. Using model averaging across the most plausible multi-state models, the fully parameterized functional response model was then used to predict intake rate for an independent data set on habitat choice by red knot. Comparison of the sites selected by red knots with random sampling sites showed that the birds fed at sites with higher than average Loripes and Dosinia densities, that is sites for which we predicted higher than average intake rates. We discuss the limitations of Holling's classic functional response model which ignores movement and the limitations of contemporary movement ecological theory that ignores consumer–resource interactions. With the rapid advancement of technologies to track movements of individual foragers at fine spatial scales, the time is ripe to integrate descriptive tracking studies with stochastic movement-based functional response models.},

Across a range of habitats, there is a negative relationship between the densities of wild dogs and of the spotted hyaena Crocuta crocuta2. It has been suggested that this is because hyaenas act as ‘kleptoparasites’ and steal food from dogs. We have now measured the daily energy expenditure of free-ranging dogs to model the impact of kleptoparasitism on energy balance. The daily energy expenditures of six dogs, measured by the doubly labelled water technique, averaged 15.3 megajoules per day. We estimated that the instantaneous cost of hunting was twenty-five times basal metabolic rate. As hunting is energetically costly, a small loss of food to kleptoparasites has a large impact on the amount of time that dogs must hunt to achieve energy balance. They normally hunt for around 3.5 hours per day but need to increase this to 12 hours if they lose 25\% of their food. This would increase their sustained metabolic scope to a physiologically unfeasible twelve times the basal metabolic rate. This may explain why there are low populations of wild dogs in regions where the risk of kleptoparasitism is high.},

  abstract = {Theoretical models pertaining to feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary processes are prevalent in multiple biological fields. An integrative overview is currently lacking, due to little crosstalk between the fields and the use of different methodological approaches. Here, we review a wide range of models of eco-evolutionary feedbacks and highlight their underlying assumptions. We discuss models where feedbacks occur both within and between hierarchical levels of ecosystems, including populations, communities and abiotic environments, and consider feedbacks across spatial scales. Identifying the commonalities among feedback models, and the underlying assumptions, helps us better understand the mechanistic basis of eco-evolutionary feedbacks. Eco-evolutionary feedbacks can be readily modelled by coupling demographic and evolutionary formalisms. We provide an overview of these approaches and suggest future integrative modelling avenues. Our overview highlights that eco-evolutionary feedbacks have been incorporated in theoretical work for nearly a century. Yet, this work does not always include the notion of rapid evolution or concurrent ecological and evolutionary time scales. We show the importance of density- and frequency-dependent selection for feedbacks, as well as the importance of dispersal as a central linking trait between ecology and evolution in a spatial context.

  abstract = {1. The ideal free distribution (IFD) has been widely used to determine whether consumers distribute themselves optimally. However, this theory is based on three assumptions that are clearly violated in many systems. The theory assumes that all individuals know the quality of each available site, are equally free to move between all sites, and have equal competitive abilities. 2. I examine the utility of this theory to predict the distribution of the invasive European green crab Carcinus maenas, a species that likely violates all of these assumptions. I demonstrate three main findings. 3. First, understanding how density-dependent interference and size alter individual foraging behaviour is important for understanding the density and biomass distribution of C. maenas in invaded habitats. 4. Second, once behavioural mechanisms of crab foraging are accurately included in the model, the IFD does a good job of predicting the distribution of C. maenas, even though C. maenas violates the theory’s fundamental assumptions. 5. Third, C. maenas’ distribution can be obtained using simple decision rules and reasonable movement patterns.},

However, there is no standard protocol for describing such simulation models, which can make them difficult to understand and to duplicate. This paper presents a proposed standard protocol, ODD, for describing IBMs and ABMs, developed and tested by 28 modellers who cover a wide range of fields within ecology. This protocol consists of three blocks (Overview, Design concepts, and Details), which are subdivided into seven elements: Purpose, State variables and scales, Process overview and scheduling, Design concepts, Initialization, Input, and Submodels. We explain which aspects of a model should be described in each element, and we present an example to illustrate the protocol in use. In addition, 19 examples are available in an Online Appendix. We consider ODD as a first step for establishing a more detailed common format of the description of IBMs and ABMs. Once initiated, the protocol will hopefully evolve as it becomes used by a sufficiently large proportion of modellers.},

  abstract = {Modern ecology recognizes that modelling systems across scales and at multiple levels—especially to link population and ecosystem dynamics to individual adaptive behaviour—is essential for making the science predictive. ‘Pattern-oriented modelling’ (POM) is a strategy for doing just this. POM is the multi-criteria design, selection and calibration of models of complex systems. POM starts with identifying a set of patterns observed at multiple scales and levels that characterize a system with respect to the particular problem being modelled; a model from which the patterns emerge should contain the right mechanisms to address the problem. These patterns are then used to (i) determine what scales, entities, variables and processes the model needs, (ii) test and select submodels to represent key low-level processes such as adaptive behaviour, and (iii) find useful parameter values during calibration. Patterns are already often used in these ways, but a mini-review of applications of POM confirms that making the selection and use of patterns more explicit and rigorous can facilitate the development of models with the right level of complexity to understand ecological systems and predict their response to novel conditions.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem and community ecology have evolved along different pathways, with little overlap. However, to meet societal demands for predicting changes in ecosystem services, the functional and structural view dominating these two branches of ecology, respectively, must be integrated. Biodiversity–ecosystem function research has addressed this integration for two decades, but full integration that makes predictions relevant to practical problems is still lacking. We argue that full integration requires going, in both branches, deeper by taking into account individual organisms and the evolutionary and physico-chemical principles that drive their behavior. Individual-based models are a major tool for this integration. They have matured by using individual-level mechanism to replace the demographic thinking which dominates classical theoretical ecology. Existing individual-based ecosystem models already have proven useful both for theory and application. Still, next-generation individual-based models will increasingly use standardized and re-usable submodels to represent behaviors and mechanisms such as growth, uptake of nutrients, foraging, and home range behavior. The strategy of pattern-oriented modeling then helps make such ecosystem models structurally realistic by developing theory for individual behaviors just detailed enough to reproduce and explain patterns observed at the system level. Next-generation ecosystem scientists should include the individual-based approach in their toolkit and focus on addressing real systems because theory development and solving applied problems go hand-in-hand in individual-based ecology.},

  abstract = {Animal social interactions are the outcomes of evolved strategies that integrate the costs and benefits of being sociable. Using a novel mechanistic, evolutionary, individual-based simulation model, we examine how animals balance the risk of pathogen transmission against the benefits of social information about resource patches, and how this determines the emergent structure of socio-spatial networks. We study a scenario in which a fitness-reducing infectious pathogen is introduced into a population which has initially evolved movement strategies in its absence. Within only a few generations, pathogen introduction provokes a rapid evolutionary shift in animals' social movement strategies, and the importance of social cues in movement decisions increases. Individuals undertake a dynamic social distancing approach, trading more movement (and less intake) for lower infection risk. Pathogen-adapted populations disperse more widely over the landscape, and thus have less clustered social networks than their pre-introduction, pathogen-naive ancestors. Running epidemiological simulations on these emergent social networks, we show that diseases do indeed spread more slowly through pathogen-adapted animal societies. Finally, the mix of post-introduction strategies is strongly influenced by a combination of landscape productivity, the usefulness of social information, and disease cost. Our model suggests that the introduction of an infectious pathogen into a population can trigger a rapid eco-evolutionary cascade, rapidly changing animals' social movement strategies, which alters movement decisions and encounters between individuals. In turn, this changes emergent social structures, and our model informs how such change can make populations more resilient to future disease outbreaks. Overall, we offer both a modelling framework and initial predictions for the evolutionary and ecological consequences of wildlife pathogen spillover scenarios.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract = {Ecosystems can undergo large-scale changes in their states, known as catastrophic regime shifts, leading to substantial losses to services they provide to humans. These shifts occur rapidly and are difficult to predict. Several early warning signals of such transitions have recently been developed using simple models. These studies typically ignore spatial interactions, and the signal provided by these indicators may be ambiguous. We employ a simple model of collapse of vegetation in one and two spatial dimensions and show, using analytic and numerical studies, that increases in spatial variance and changes in spatial skewness occur as one approaches the threshold of vegetation collapse. We identify a novel feature, an increasing spatial variance in conjunction with a peaking of spatial skewness, as an unambiguous indicator of an impending regime shift. Once a signal has been detected, we show that a quick management action reducing the grazing activity is needed to prevent the collapse of vegetated state. Our results show that the difficulties in obtaining the accurate estimates of indicators arising due to lack of long temporal data can be alleviated when high-resolution spatially extended data are available. These results are shown to hold true independent of various details of model or different spatial dispersal kernels such as Gaussian or heavily fat tailed. This study suggests that spatial data and monitoring multiple indicators of regime shifts can play a key role in making reliable predictions on ecosystem stability and resilience.},

  abstract = {Migration of organisms (or cells) is typically an adaptive response to spatiotemporal variation in resources that requires individuals to detect and respond to long-range and noisy environmental gradients. Many organisms, from wildebeest to bacteria, migrate en masse in a process that can involve a vast number of individuals. Despite the ubiquity of collective migration, and the key function it plays in the ecology of many species, it is still unclear what role social interactions play in the evolution of migratory strategies. Here, we explore the evolution of migratory behavior using an individual-based spatially explicit model that incorporates the costs and benefits of obtaining directional cues from the environment and evolvable social interactions among migrating individuals. We demonstrate that collective migratory strategies evolve under a wide range of ecological scenarios, even when social encounters are rare. Although collective migration appears to be a shared navigational process, populations typically consist of small proportions of individuals actively acquiring directional information from their environment, whereas the majorities use a socially facilitated movement behavior. Because many migratory species face severe threat through anthropogenic influences, we also explore the microevolutionary response of migratory strategies to environmental pressures. We predict a gradual decline of migration due to increasing habitat destruction and argue that much greater restoration is required to recover lost behaviors (i.e., a strong hysteresis effect). Our results provide insights into both the proximate and ultimate factors that underlie evolved migratory behavior in nature.}

Such large-scale spatial organization is preceded locally by a dramatic density-dependent phenotypic transition in multiple traits. Behaviourally, low-density ‘solitarious’ individuals avoid contact with one another; above a critical local density, they undergo a rapid behavioural transition to the ‘gregarious phase’ whereby they exhibit mutual attraction. Although proximate causes of this phase polyphenism have been widely studied, the ultimate driving factors remain unclear. Using an individual-based evolutionary model, we reveal that cannibalism, a striking feature of locust ecology, could lead to the evolution of density-dependent behavioural phase-change in juvenile locusts. We show that this behavioural strategy minimizes risk associated with cannibalistic interactions and may account for the empirically observed persistence of locust groups during outbreaks. Our results provide a parsimonious explanation for the evolution of behavioural plasticity in locusts.},

We focus on an established model of kleptoparasitism and investigate whether and how much population heterogeneities can affect the behaviour of kleptoparasitic populations. We consider a situation where animals can either discover food items by themselves or attempt to steal the food already discovered by other animals through aggressive interactions. Representing the likely interactions between animals by a network, we develop pairwise and individual-based models to describe heterogeneities in both the population structure and other individual characteristics, including searching and fighting abilities. For each of the models developed we derive analytic solutions at the steady state. The high accuracy of the solutions is shown in various examples of populations with different degrees of heterogeneity. We observe that highly heterogeneous structures can significantly affect the food intake rate and therefore the fitness of animals. In particular, the more highly connected animals engage in more conflicts, and have a reduced food consumption rate compared to poorly connected animals. Further, for equivalent average level of connectedness, the average consumption rate of a population with heterogeneous structure can be higher.},

  abstract = {Our objective is to determine the evolutionarily stable strategy [14] that is supposed to drive the behavior of foragers competing for a common patchily distributed resource [16]. Compared to [18], the innovation lies in the fact that random arrival times are allowed.In this first part, we investigate scramble competition: the game still yields simple Charnov-like strategies [4]. Thus we attempt to compute the optimal longterm mean rate γ* [11] at which resources should be gathered to achieve the maximum expected fitness: the assumed symmetry among foragers allows us to express γ* as a solution of an implicit equation, independent of the probability distribution of arrival times.A digression on a simple model of group foraging shows that γ*N can be simply computed via the classical graph associated to the marginal value theorem—N is the size of the group. An analytical solution allows us to characterize the decline in efficiency due to group foraging, as opposed to foraging alone: this loss can be relatively low, even in a “bad world,” provided that the handling time is relatively long.Back to the original problem, we then assume that the arrivals on the patch follow a Poisson process. Thus we find an explicit expression of γ* that makes it possible to perform a numerical computation: Charnov’s predictions still hold under scramble competition.Finally, we show that the distribution of foragers among patches is not homogeneous but biased in favor of bad patches. This result is in agreement with common observation and theoretical knowledge [1] about the concept of ideal free distribution [12, 22].},

  abstract = {MOST environments are spatially subdivided, or patchy, and there has been much interest in the relationship between the dynamics of populations at the local and regional (metapopulation) scales1. Here we study mathematical models for host-parasitoid interactions, where in each generation specified fractions (µN and µp, respectively) of the host and parasitoid subpopulations in each patch move to adjacent patches; in most previous work, the movement is not localized but is to any other patch2. These simple and biologically sensible models with limited diffusive dispersal exhibit a remarkable range of dynamic behaviour: the density of the host and parasitoid subpopulations in a two-dimensional array of patches may exhibit complex patterns of spiral waves or spatially chaotic variation, they may show static 'crystal lattice' patterns, or they may become extinct. This range of behaviour is obtained with the local dynamics being deterministically unstable, with a constant host reproductive rate and no density dependence in the movement patterns. The dynamics depend on the host reproductive rate, and on the values of the parameters µN and µp. The results are relatively insensitive to the details of the interactions; we get essentially the same results from the mathematically-explicit Nicholon–Bailey model of host-parasitoid interactions, and from a very general 'cellular automaton' model in which only qualitative rules are specified. We conclude that local movement in a patchy environment can help otherwise unstable host and parasitoid populations to persist together, but that the deterministically generated spatial patterns in population density can be exceedingly complex (and sometimes indistinguishable from random environmental fluctuations).},

  abstract = {Wildlife management to reduce the impact of wildlife on their habitat can be done in several ways, among which removing animals (by either culling or translocation) is most often used. There are, however, alternative ways to control wildlife densities, such as opening or closing water points. The effects of these alternatives are poorly studied. In this paper, we focus on manipulating large herbivores through the closure of water points (WPs). Removal of artificial WPs has been suggested in order to change the distribution of African elephants, which occur in high densities in national parks in Southern Africa and are thought to have a destructive effect on the vegetation. Here, we modeled the long-term effects of different scenarios of WP closure on the spatial distribution of elephants, and consequential effects on the vegetation and other herbivores in Kruger National Park, South Africa. Using a dynamic ecosystem model, SAVANNA, scenarios were evaluated that varied in availability of artificial WPs; levels of natural water; and elephant densities. Our modeling results showed that elephants can indirectly negatively affect the distributions of meso-mixed feeders, meso-browsers, and some meso-grazers under wet conditions. The closure of artificial WPs hardly had any effect during these natural wet conditions. Under dry conditions, the spatial distribution of both elephant bulls and cows changed when the availability of artificial water was severely reduced in the model. These changes in spatial distribution triggered changes in the spatial availability of woody biomass over the simulation period of 80 years, and this led to changes in the rest of the herbivore community, resulting in increased densities of all herbivores, except for giraffe and steenbok, in areas close to rivers. The spatial distributions of elephant bulls and cows showed to be less affected by the closure of WPs than most of the other herbivore species. Our study contributes to ecologically informed decisions in wildlife management. The results from this modeling exercise imply that long-term effects of this intervention strategy should always be investigated at an ecosystem scale.},

So far, evidence for this idea has remained elusive, and integrated climate models assume smooth vegetation responses. We analyzed data on the distribution of tree cover in Africa, Australia, and South America to reveal strong evidence for the existence of three distinct attractors: forest, savanna, and a treeless state. Empirical reconstruction of the basins of attraction indicates that the resilience of the states varies in a universal way with precipitation. These results allow the identification of regions where forest or savanna may most easily tip into an alternative state, and they pave the way to a new generation of coupled climate models.

  abstract = {1. The spatial distribution of foraging predators differing in foraging traits was investigated theoretically. Three types of individual differences were investigated: dominance that determines the outcomes in fights for food, searching efficiency and prey handling efficiency. The basic assumptions were: (i) predators search for prey; (ii) encountered prey takes time to handle; (iii) the handling process may be interrupted by a searching competitor initiating a conflict about the prey; (iv) conflicts take an expected time to settle; and (v) the winner resumes handling and the loser resumes searching. 2. Stable equilibrium distributions were found in all cases, in the sense that no competitor could achieve a higher intake rate from switching patch. 3. When it was assumed that each of the predators was different from the others, the ideal free distributions of the dominance model and the handling efficiency model resembled one another. A boundary phenotype existed with more dominant/efficient competitors only occurring in the high prey density patch and less dominant/efficient ones occurring mixed across patches. This was labelled semitruncated distribution. In the search efficiency model, the distribution was truncated, i.e. competitors less efficient than the boundary phenotype only occurred in the high prey density patch whereas the more efficient competitors occurred in the low prey density patch. 4. The models were also analysed with the predators classified into two types. As the density of competitors increased, the solution approached a set of neutral equilibria where a few predators of the more efficient type could be exchanged for a larger number of the less efficient type to reach a new equilibrium. 5. The density of predators may be negatively correlated with patch productivity and prey density when predators differ in handling efficiency. Prey-searching efficiency of predators was negatively correlated with predator density, patch productivity and prey density. Its consequences for the conservation of species are discussed.},

We tested this prediction, and the role of gliding altitude and soaring conditions, using atmospheric simulations and radar tracks of 1346 birds from 12 species. Gliding airspeed did not scale with bird size and wing morphology, and unexpectedly converged to a narrow range. To explain this discrepancy, we propose that soaring-gliding birds adjust their gliding airspeed according to the risk of grounding or switching to costly flapping flight. Introducing the Risk Aversion Flight Index (RAFI, the ratio of actual to theoretical risk-averse gliding airspeed), we found that inter- and intraspecific variation in RAFI positively correlated with wing loading, and negatively correlated with convective thermal conditions and gliding altitude, respectively. We propose that risk-sensitive behaviour modulates the evolution (morphology) and ecology (response to environmental conditions) of bird soaring flight.},

  abstract = {Ideal free distributions characterise how a group of animals should be distributed between sources of food. In a simple case, the ratio of the number of animals matches the ratio of input rates, a result known as input matching. The matching law characterises how an animal should allocate responses to sources of food. If matching holds then the ratio of behaviour allocated to the sources matches the ratio of rewards obtained. Several authors have drawn attention to the analogy between input matching and the matching law. I present a critical review of this topic, and go on to investigate the claim that the distribution of animals should be analyzed in the same way that the generalized matching law is analyzed. This involves assuming that the relationship between the ratio of animals and the ratio of resources obeys a power law with two parameters, one corresponding to bias and the other to sensitivity. On this view, a plot of the log of the ratio of animals against the log of the ratio of input rates will be a straight line and its intercept and slope will provide estimates of bias and sensitivity. I show that this approach can give a good fit even when the underlying model does not result in a power law. A consequence is that the parameters estimated cannot be interpreted as bias and sensitivity. I conclude that there are no compelling reasons for analyzing the distribution of animals using log-log plots, and the method has the disadvantage of encouraging the mistaken view that deviations from input matching follow a power law.},

Whether such an intergenerational system occurs in other species is harder to demonstrate. Ilany et al. looked at nearly 30 years of social interaction data in spotted hyenas, a female-dominated system with a highly structured society, and found that status inheritance is just as prominent (see the Perspective by Firth and Sheldon). Juvenile hyenas had social associations that were similar to their mothers, and the strength of the association was higher for higher-status mothers. Importantly, survival was associated with social inheritance, suggesting that these social roles are essential to hyena life. Science, abc1966, this issue p. 348; see also abj5234, p. 274 The structure of animal social networks influences survival and reproductive success, as well as pathogen and information transmission. However, the general mechanisms determining social structure remain unclear. Using data from 73,767 social interactions among wild spotted hyenas collected over 27 years, we show that the process of social inheritance determines how offspring relationships are formed and maintained. Relationships between offspring and other hyenas bear resemblance to those of their mothers for as long as 6 years, and the degree of similarity increases with maternal social rank. Mother-offspring relationship strength affects social inheritance and is positively correlated with offspring longevity. These results support the hypothesis that social inheritance of relationships can structure animal social networks and be subject to adaptive tradeoffs. Observations of wild spotted hyena social behaviors over 27 years reveal how offspring relationships are formed and maintained.

  abstract = {1 The Ideal Free Distribution (IFD) is one of the most widely applied theoretical concepts in ecology. Many experimental tests of the IFD incorporating unequal competitors have revealed three consistent departures of observed results from those predicted by the theory. Specifically these are: (1) the full range of predicted equilibria are rarely realized; (2) under-matching of individuals to resource inputs; and (3) continued movement of individuals after equilibrium is reached. 2 It has been suggested previously that a model including simple random movements can explain simultaneously all three of these departures. The acceptance of this theory has been hindered by arguments about model construction relating to the timing of events and whether an analytical or individual-based model is more appropriate. 3 Here we present the first internally consistent and biologically realistic model of the IFD incorporating random non-IFD movements (movements made at a rate independent of intake rates). We use this model to confirm that random movements alone can explain all three of the observed departures from the IFD. Furthermore, it is not necessary to have any detailed a priori knowledge about the motivation behind the non-IFD movements, in order to predict their consequences. We expect non-IFD movements to be widespread in animal systems, and so warrant further experimental consideration and investigation.},

Recent technological and conceptual advances have improved our ability to assess the causes and consequences of individual movement, and led to the emergence of the new field of ‘movement ecology’. Here, we outline how movement ecology can contribute to the broad field of biodiversity research, i.e. the study of processes and patterns of life among and across different scales, from genes to ecosystems, and we propose a conceptual framework linking these hitherto largely separated fields of research. Our framework builds on the concept of movement ecology for individuals, and demonstrates its importance for linking individual organismal movement with biodiversity. First, organismal movements can provide ‘mobile links’ between habitats or ecosystems, thereby connecting resources, genes, and processes among otherwise separate locations. Understanding these mobile links and their impact on biodiversity will be facilitated by movement ecology, because mobile links can be created by different modes of movement (i.e., foraging, dispersal, migration) that relate to different spatiotemporal scales and have differential effects on biodiversity. Second, organismal movements can also mediate coexistence in communities, through ‘equalizing’ and ‘stabilizing’ mechanisms. This novel integrated framework provides a conceptual starting point for a better understanding of biodiversity dynamics in light of individual movement and space-use behavior across spatiotemporal scales. By illustrating this framework with examples, we argue that the integration of movement ecology and biodiversity research will also enhance our ability to conserve diversity at the genetic, species, and ecosystem levels.},

Neighbourhood interactions between local units are known to contribute to large–scale patterns, but how much do they contribute and what is the role of regional interactions caused by long–distance processes? How much long–distance dispersal do we need to explain the patterns that we observe in nature? There seems to be no way to answer these questions empirically. Therefore, we present a modelling approach that is a combination of a grid–based model describing local interactions and an individual–based model describing dispersal. Applying our approach to the spread of rabies, we show that in addition to local rabies dynamics, one long–distance infection per 14000km2 per year is sufficient to reproduce the wave–like spread of this disease. We conclude that even rare ecological events that couple local dynamics on a regional scale may have profound impacts on large–scale patterns and, in turn, dynamics. Furthermore, the following results emerge: (i) Both neighbourhood infection and long–distance infection are needed to generate the wave–like dispersal pattern of rabies; (ii) randomly walking rabid foxes are not sufficient to generate the wave pattern; and (iii) on a scale of less than 100 km times 100 km, temporal oscillations emerge that are independent from long–distance dispersal.},

  abstract = {Learning where and when Large ungulate migrations occur across continents and inspire curiosity about how these animals know when to leave and where to go. Jesmer et al. took advantage of regional extinctions and reintroductions of several North American ungulate species to determine the role of learning in migrations (see the Perspective by Festa-Bianchet). Reintroduced populations of bighorn sheep and moose did not migrate as historical herds had. However, after several decades, newly established herds were better able to track the emergence of vegetation in the environment and were increasingly migratory. Thus, newly introduced animals learned about their environment and shared the information through social exchange. Science, this issue p. 1023; see also p. 972 Ungulate migrations are assumed to stem from learning and cultural transmission of information regarding seasonal distribution of forage, but this hypothesis has not been tested empirically. We compared the migratory propensities of bighorn sheep and moose translocated into novel habitats with those of historical populations that had persisted for hundreds of years. Whereas individuals from historical populations were largely migratory, translocated individuals initially were not. After multiple decades, however, translocated populations gained knowledge about surfing green waves of forage (tracking plant phenology) and increased their propensity to migrate. Our findings indicate that learning and cultural transmission are the primary mechanisms by which ungulate migrations evolve. Loss of migration will therefore expunge generations of knowledge about the locations of high-quality forage and likely suppress population abundance. Bighorn sheep and moose learn their migration routes through culture and experience. Bighorn sheep and moose learn their migration routes through culture and experience.},

  abstract = {Dispersal is a critical, but costly, stage of life. During the active phase of dispersal—called transience—individuals face many costs, from increased mortality to reduced foraging opportunities. One cost that is often assumed, but rarely explicitly tested, is the energy expended in making large dispersal movements. However, this cost is not only determined by the distance individual’s move, but also how they move. Using high-resolution GPS tracking of dispersing and resident vulturine guineafowl (Acryllium vulturinum), we show that transient individuals exhibit distinct movement behaviours—travelling farther, faster and straighter—that result in a significant reduction in the energetic costs of making large displacements. This strategy allows dispersing birds to travel, on average, 33.8\% farther each day with only a 4.1\% cost increase and without spending more time moving. Our study suggests that adaptive movement strategies can largely mitigate movement costs during dispersal, and that such strategies may be common.},

  abstract = {A “landscape of fear” (LOF) is a map that describes continuous spatial variation in an animal's perception of predation risk. The relief on this map reflects, for example, places that an animal avoids to minimize risk. Although the LOF concept is a potentially unifying theme in ecology that is often invoked to explain the ecological and conservation significance of fear, little is known about the daily dynamics of an LOF. Despite theory and data to the contrary, investigators often assume, implicitly or explicitly, that an LOF is a static consequence of a predator's mere presence within an ecosystem. We tested the prediction that an LOF in a large-scale, free-living system is a highly dynamic map with “peaks” and “valleys” that alternate across the diel (24-h) cycle in response to daily lulls in predator activity. We did so with extensive data from the case study of Yellowstone elk (Cervus elaphus) and wolves (Canis lupus) that was the original basis for the LOF concept. We quantified the elk LOF, defined here as spatial allocation of time away from risky places and times, across nearly 1,000-km2 of northern Yellowstone National Park and found that it fluctuated with the crepuscular activity pattern of wolves, enabling elk to use risky places during wolf downtimes. This may help explain evidence that wolf predation risk has no effect on elk stress levels, body condition, pregnancy, or herbivory. The ability of free-living animals to adaptively allocate habitat use across periods of high and low predator activity within the diel cycle is an underappreciated aspect of animal behavior that helps explain why strong antipredator responses may trigger weak ecological effects, and why an LOF may have less conceptual and practical importance than direct killing.},

The two main approaches involve perceptual constraints and unequal competitors. Here we present a model of social foragers choosing among resource patches. Each forager makes a probabilistic choice on the basis of the information acquired through past foraging experiences. Food acquisition is determined by the forager’s competitive ability. This model predicts that perceptual constraints have a greater influence on the spatial distribution of foragers than unequal competitive abilities but that competitive ability plays an important role in determining an individual’s information state and behavior. Better competitors have access to more information; consequently, we find that competitive abilities and perceptual constraints are integrated through the social environment occupied by individual foragers. Relative competitive abilities influence the forager’s information state, and the ability to use information determines the resulting spatial distribution.},

Using mussel beds as a model ecosystem, we provide an experimental demonstration of spatial self-organization. Under homogeneous laboratory conditions, mussels developed regular patterns, similar to those in the field. An individual-based model derived from our experiments showed that interactions between individuals explained the observed patterns. Furthermore, a field study showed that pattern formation affected ecosystem-level processes in terms of improved growth and resistance to wave action. Our results imply that spatial self-organization is an important determinant of the structure and functioning of ecosystems, and it needs to be considered in their conservation. Interactions among individual mussels result in large-scale spatial patterns in mussel beds that are beneficial to the population—by promoting secondary production, for example.

  abstract = {In the Hudson–James Bay system, grubbing and grazing by lesser snow geese have resulted in severe devegetation of coastal marshes. These changes likely represent an example of an alternative stable state; however, long-term datasets documenting whether revegetation is occurring are scarce. Here, we report results of a 10-year study investigating changes in the state of a degraded salt marsh system on the north coast of Akimiski Island, Nunavut. Four transects were intensively sampled in 1998 and 2008, two within the dense nesting and brood-rearing area of a snow geese colony, one on the colony edge, and one outside it; all of these sites were also used by broods of Canada geese. Key forage species (Puccinellia phryganodes, Festuca rubra, Carex subspathacea) were less common near the colony center than elsewhere; biomass of Puccinellia also tended to be lower in more central areas. Forage species often increased in abundance between samplings, but the magnitude of changes was small. In contrast, non-forage species (Salicornia, Spergularia, Glaux) often reached high abundance within the colony center; some (Salicornia) decreased while others (Spergularia) increased. We argue the degraded state was initiated by foraging damage from an exceptional stopover of 295,000 staging birds in 1972 and that the combined foraging pressure of relatively small numbers of nesting and migrant geese since then, coupled with soil changes, has been sufficient to maintain devegetated areas as a persistent alternative state. Whether or not this state is truly stable, further recovery is likely to be very slow.},

On territorial behavior and other factors influencing habitat distribution in birds. Acta Biotheoretica 19, 16–32] to predict how a single species will distribute itself among several patches, is often cited as an example of an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). By defining the strategies and payoffs for habitat selection, this article puts the IFD concept in a more general game-theoretic setting of the “habitat selection game”. Within this game-theoretic framework, the article focuses on recent progress in the following directions: (1) studying evolutionarily stable dispersal rates and corresponding dispersal dynamics; (2) extending the concept when population numbers are not fixed but undergo population dynamics; (3) generalizing the IFD to multiple species. For a single species, the article briefly reviews existing results. It also develops a new perspective for Parker’s matching principle, showing that this can be viewed as the IFD of the habitat selection game that models consumer behavior in several resource patches and analyzing complications involved when the model includes resource dynamics as well. For two species, the article first demonstrates that the connection between IFD and ESS is now more delicate by pointing out pitfalls that arise when applying several existing game-theoretic approaches to these habitat selection games. However, by providing a new detailed analysis of dispersal dynamics for predator–prey or competitive interactions in two habitats, it also pinpoints one approach that shows much promise in this general setting, the so-called “two-species ESS”. The consequences of this concept are shown to be related to recent studies of population dynamics combined with individual dispersal and are explored for more species or more patches.},

  abstract = {Determining connectivity within complex landscapes is difficult if habitats that facilitate dispersal differ from habitats where animals normally are found or enter. We addressed the question of how landscape features affect dispersal by quantifying two critical aspects of animal movement behavior that determine dispersal rates across complex landscapes: conductivity of major habitat types and behavior at boundaries between habitat types. Our tests consisted of behavioral experiments and observational surveys of a wetland butterfly, Satyrodes appalachia. Displacement rates varied among habitats, with the longest moves and straightest paths leading to greater displacement rate in open habitat and shortest moves and most sinuous paths causing the slowest displacement rate in riparian forest habitat. We found a strong negative relationship between the probability of entering a habitat and the speed of moving through it. Recognizing this central conflict between entering and moving through habitat is important for assessing the connectivity of complex landscapes.},

  abstract = {Theory predicts that consumers can increase their energy intake by spending more time within resource-rich areas and/or by avoiding areas where local competitor densities are high. A consumer whose movements are described by a simple random walk can achieve these objectives by adjusting its turn frequency and/or speed. We recorded movements, as series of steps, by 180 individual rotifers (Brachionus calyciflorus) in glass capillary tubes to test the influence of resource density, competitor density and their statistical interaction on movement parameters. Four treatments contrasted opposing levels of algae (resource) and conspecific density in a 2 × 2 factorial design. Our results indicate that density- and resource-dependent behaviours act through different mechanisms to shape patterns of rotifer movement. Turn frequency increased up to twofold in resource-rich treatments, depending on the presence or absence of competitors. In contrast, swimming speed was 50\% greater in the presence of competitors under all treatments, but was only slightly depressed by the presence of resources alone. We show how these two different movement mechanisms may be integrated into predictions of consumer population spread as resource and competitor densities vary. We discuss implications of the contrasting and complementary nature of these different movement mechanisms and their possible adaptations to different environmental stimuli.},

In support of model predictions, individuals consistently differed in behavioural plasticity when the presence of conspecifics influenced the potential payoffs of a foraging opportunity. Whether individuals maintained their level of behavioural plasticity when placed in a new social group depended on the environmental heterogeneity.

Environmental and genetic phenotype determination are the two main categories of polymorphic development. Even though both may evolve as a response to varied environments, they are traditionally regarded as fundamentally distinct phenomena. They can however be joined into a single framework that emphasizes the parallel roles of environmental and genetic cues in phenotype determination. First, from the point of view of immediate causation, it is common that phenotypic variants can be induced either by environmental or by allelic variation, and this is referred to as gene-environment interchangeability. Second, from the point of view of adaptation, genetic cues in the form of allelic variation at polymorphic loci can play similar roles as environmental cues in providing information to the developmental system about coming selective conditions. Both types of cues can help a developing organism to fit its phenotype to selective circumstances. This perspective of information in environmental and genetic cues can produce testable hypotheses about phenotype determination, and can thus increase our understanding of the evolution of phenotypic polymorphism.},

  abstract = {Summary The loss of apex consumers (large mammals at the top of their food chain) is a major driver of global change [1]. Yet, research on the two main apex consumer guilds, large carnivores [2] and megaherbivores [3], has developed independently, overlooking any potential interactions. Large carnivores provoke behavioral responses in prey [1, 4], driving prey to distribute themselves within a “landscape of fear” [5] and intensify their impacts on lower trophic levels in low-risk areas [6], where they may concentrate nutrients through localized dung deposition [7, 8]. We suggest, however, that megaherbivores modify carnivore-induced trophic cascades. Megaherbivores ({$>$}1,000~kg [9]) are largely invulnerable to predation and should respond less to the landscape of fear, thereby counteracting the effects of fear-triggered trophic cascades. By experimentally clearing plots to increase visibility and reduce predation risk, we tested the collective role of both apex consumer guilds in influencing nutrient dynamics in African savanna. We evaluated whether megaherbivores could counteract a behaviorally mediated trophic cascade by redistributing nutrients that accumulate through fear-driven prey aggregations. Our experiment showed that mesoherbivores concentrated fecal nutrients in more open habitat, but that megaherbivores moved nutrients against this fear-driven nutrient accumulation by feeding within the open habitat, yet defecating more evenly across the risk gradient. This work adds to the growing recognition of functional losses that are likely to have accompanied megafaunal extinctions by contributing empirical evidence from one of the last systems with a functionally complete megaherbivore assemblage. Our results suggest that carnivore-induced trophic cascades work differently in a world of giants.},

  abstract = {It is argued that the problem of pattern and scale is the central problem in ecology, unifying population biology and ecosystems science, and marrying basic and applied ecology. Applied challenges, such as the prediction of the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change, require the interfacing of phenomena that occur on very different scales of space, time, and ecological organization. Furthermore, there is no single natural scale at which ecological phenomena should be studied; systems generally show characteristic variability on a range of spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. The observer imposes a perceptual bias, a filter through which the system is viewed. This has fundamental evolutionary significance, since every organism is an 'observer' of the environment, and life history adaptations such as dispersal and dormancy alter the perceptual scales of the species, and the observed variability. It likewise has fundamental significance for our own study of ecological systems, since the patterns that are unique to any range of scales will have unique causes and biological consequences. The key to prediction and understanding lies in the elucidation of mechanisms underlying observed patterns. Typically, these mechanisms operate at different scales than those on which the patterns are observed; in some cases, the patterns must be understood as emerging form the collective behaviors of large ensembles of smaller scale units. In other cases, the pattern is imposed by larger scale constraints. Examination of such phenomena requires the study of how pattern and variability change with the scale of description, and the development of laws for simplification, aggregation, and scaling. Examples are given from the marine and terrestrial literatures.},

For instance, turbulence in the water arising from natural or anthropogenic structures can affect foraging opportunities in tidal seas. Yet, identifying ecologically important localized turbulence features (e.g. upwellings approximately 10–100 m) is limited by observational scale, and this knowledge gap is magnified in volatile predators. Here, using a drone-based approach, we present the tracking of surface-foraging terns (143 trajectories belonging to three tern species) and dynamic turbulent surface flow features in synchrony. We thereby provide the earliest evidence that localized turbulence features can present physical foraging cues. Incorporating evolving vorticity and upwelling features within a hidden Markov model, we show that terns were more likely to actively forage as the strength of the underlying vorticity feature increased, while conspicuous upwellings ahead of the flight path presented a strong physical cue to stay in transit behaviour. This clearly encapsulates the importance of prevalent turbulence features as localized foraging cues. Our quantitative approach therefore offers the opportunity to unlock knowledge gaps in seabird sensory and foraging ecology on hitherto unobtainable scales. Finally, it lays the foundation to predict responses to coastal change to inform sustainable ocean development.},

Here, we use an individual-based simulation approach to investigate the evolutionary emergence and stability of parental roles. Our conclusions are in striking contrast to the results of analytical models. In the absence of initial differences between the sexes, our simulations do not predict the evolution of egalitarian care, but either female-biased or male-biased care. When the sexes differ in their pre-mating investment, the sex with the highest investment tends to evolve a higher level of parental care; this outcome does not depend on non-random mating or uncertainty of paternity. If parental investment evolves jointly with sexual selection strategies, evolution results in either the combination of female-biased care and female choosiness or in male-biased care and the absence of female preferences. The simulations suggest that the parental care pattern drives sexual selection, and not \emph{vice versa}. Finally, our model reveals that a population can rapidly switch from one type of equilibrium to another one, suggesting that parental sex roles are evolutionarily labile. By combining simulation results with fitness calculations, we argue that all these results are caused by the emergence of individual variation in parental care strategies, a factor that was hitherto largely neglected in sex-role evolution theory.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Ideal free distribution (IFD) theory offers an important baseline for predicting the distribution of foragers across resource patches. Yet it is well known that IFD theory relies on several over-simplifying assumptions that are unlikely to be met in reality. Here we relax three of the most critical assumptions: (1) optimal foraging moves among patches, (2) omniscience about the utility of resource patches, and (3) cost-free travelling between patches. Based on these generalizations, we investigate the distributions of a constant number of foragers in models with explicit resource dynamics of logistic type. We find that, first, when foragers do not always move to the patch offering maximum intake rate (optimal foraging), but instead move probabilistically according to differences in resource intake rates between patches (sub-optimal foraging), the distribution of foragers becomes less skewed than the IFD, so that high-quality patches attract fewer foragers. Second, this homogenization is strengthened when foragers have less than perfect knowledge about the utility of resource patches. Third, and perhaps most surprisingly, the introduction of travelling costs causes departures in the opposite direction: the distribution of sub-optimal foragers approaches the IFD as travelling costs increase. We demonstrate that these three findings are robust when considering patches that differ in the resource's carrying capacity or intrinsic growth rate, and when considering simple two-patch and more complex multiple-patch models. By overcoming three major over-simplifications of IFD theory, our analyses contribute to the systematic investigation of ecological factors influencing the spatial distribution of foragers, and thus help in deriving new hypotheses that are testable in empirical systems. A confluence of theoretical and empirical studies that go beyond classical IFD theory is essential for improving insights into how animal distributions across resource patches are determined in nature.},

These include genetic effects, transgenerational epigenetic influences, environmental cues and developmental noise, which are rarely investigated in the same formal framework. We study an analytically tractable evolutionary model, in which cues are integrated to determine mature phenotypes in fluctuating environments. Environmental cues received during development and by the mother as an adult act as detection-based (individually observed) cues. The mother's phenotype and a quantitative genetic effect act as selection-based cues (they correlate with environmental states after selection). We specify when such cues are complementary and tend to be used together, and when using the most informative cue will predominate. Thus, we extend recent analyses of the evolutionary implications of subsets of these effects by providing a general diagnosis of the conditions under which detection and selection-based influences on development are likely to evolve and coexist.},

  abstract = {1 The predator-dependent Beddington–DeAngelis functional response model can be considered as an extension of the prey-dependent Holling's type II functional response model, since it includes, apart from the states ‘searching for prey’ and ‘handling prey’, a third behavioural state, namely ‘mutual interference with competitors’. The model is further based upon the underlying idea of mass action, which means that it is assumed that predator and prey numbers are infinitely large. 2 This latter assumption casts doubt on the applicability of the model to experimental situations, which have been used to estimate the underlying behavioural parameters, because such experiments are usually performed with very few competitors. 3 Therefore, a stochastic version of the Beddington–DeAngelis model is presented which overcomes these problems. A maximum-likelihood procedure for parameter estimation is presented and applied to shore crabs foraging on blue mussels. 4 In passing, a mistake in the derivation of the deterministic Beddington–DeAngelis model is corrected, resulting in a slightly different solution.},

  abstract = {We studied, both theoretically and empirically, the effect of intra— and interspecific competition on the foraging effort of individuals. We considered two models, one for a time—minimizer satisfying an energy requirement, the other for an animal maximizing fitness as a function of multiple inputs subject to a time constraint. The goal of satisfying an energy constraint predicts that foraging effort should increase with increased competition. The goal of maximizing fitness subject to a time constraint on multiple inputs may also predict that foraging effort should increase with increased competition because of the missed opportunity cost that results when different inputs are complementary. However, if the fitness—maximizer with multiple inputs incurs an energy cost of foraging (in addition to missed opportunity costs), then it should often reduce foraging effort in response to an increase in competition. We experimentally tested the foraging response to increased competition by two species of gerbils, Gerbillus allenbyi and G. pyramidum, over a range of manipulated population densities in field enclosures located in the Negev Desert of Israel. Our results support the cost—benefit model when the additional energy cost of foraging is important. Per capita activity (as measured by spoor) declined as a function of intraspecific density for each species and as a function of interspecific density for G. allenbyi. We detected no interspecific effect, however, on G. pyramidum.},

However, it is not clear whatmmeans in terms of behaviour. This is because the Hassell \& Varley model, from whichmis derived, only provides a description of the interference process without alluding to the mechanisms underlying the relationship. In this paper a behaviour-based, analytical model is described which finds the ideal free distribution of predators searching for food in a patchy environment. An interference expression from a model developed by Ruxton et al. (1992,Theor. Pop. Biol.,42,235-253) based on the interactions of a group of predators with each other and their prey is used to obtain the ideal free distribution over any finite number of food patches for different prey distributions. Using examples of environments with two and three patches, the effects of the degree of interference and the total prey density on such distributions are also studied. Contrary to many published results, an over-representation of predators in the best patch is always predicted. This effect is enhanced by increasing prey abundance. When interference is the result of wasted time,mcannot exceed 1; in most casesmis expected to be very low.},

  abstract = {Kleptoparasitism, the stealing of food items already procured by others, is a widespread foraging strategy in animals, yet the reasons why some taxa have evolved this strategy and others have not remain unresolved. It has been hypothesized that kleptoparasitism should be more profitable, and hence have more often evolved, in lineages featuring certain characteristics, such as a large body mass, an enlarged brain or a dependence on vertebrate prey. Alternatively, the evolution of kleptoparasitism could have been facilitated in certain ecological contexts, such as open habitats or mixed-species foraging groups. Here, we test these hypotheses for the evolution of food stealing with a comparative analysis in birds, using information on 856 field reports of interspecific kleptoparasitism from all over the world. In multivariate analyses controlling for common ancestry, the probability that a family uses kleptoparasitism was positively associated with residual size of the brain, habitat openness and the presence of vertebrate prey in the diet, but showed no association with body size or participation in mixed-species foraging groups. The conclusion that kleptoparasitism is associated more closely with cognition than with aggression is further supported by the finding that kleptoparasites have a larger residual brain size than their respective hosts, while their body size is not significantly larger. By emphasizing the central role of cognitive abilities in avian kleptoparasitism, our results offer a novel perception of avian food stealing, which in the past was primarily seen in terms of ‘brawn’ rather than ‘brains’.},

However species competition is a consistently missing variable in Species Distribution Modelling (SDM). This study presents results of our attempt to incorporate species competition in SDMs. We used a suit of predictor variables including Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), as well as distance from roads, settlements and water, fire frequency and distance from the nearest herbivore sighting (of selected herbivores) to model individual habitat preferences of five grazer species (buffalo, warthog, waterbuck, wildebeest and zebra) with the Ensemble SDM algorithm for Gonarezhou National Park, Zimbabwe. Our results showed that distance from the nearest animal sighting (a proxy for competition among grazers) was the best predictor of the potential distribution of buffalo, wildebeest and zebra but the second best predictor for warthog and waterbuck. Our findings provide evidence to that competition is an important predictor of grazer species’ potential distribution. These findings suggest that species distribution modelling that neglects species competition may be inadequate in explaining the potential distribution of species. Therefore our findings encourage the inclusion of competition in SDM as well as potentially igniting discussions that may lead to improving the predictive power of future SDM efforts.},

  abstract = {Understanding complex movement behaviors via mechanistic models is one key challenge in movement ecology. We built a theoretical simulation model using evolutionarily trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) wherein individuals evolve movement behaviors in response to resource landscapes on which they search and navigate. We distinguished among non-oriented movements in response to proximate stimuli, oriented movements utilizing perceptual cues from distant targets, and memory mechanisms that assume prior knowledge of a target’s location and then tested the relevance of these three movement behaviors in relation to size of resource patches, predictability of resource landscapes, and the occurrence of movement barriers. Individuals were more efficient in locating resources under larger patch sizes and predictable landscapes when memory was advantageous. However, memory was also frequently used in unpredictable landscapes with intermediate patch sizes to systematically search the entire spatial domain, and because of this, we suggest that memory may be important in explaining super-diffusion observed in many empirical studies. The sudden imposition of movement barriers had the greatest effect under predictable landscapes and temporarily eliminated the benefits of memory. Overall, we demonstrate how movement behaviors that are linked to certain cognitive abilities can be represented by state variables in ANNs and how, by altering these state variables, the relevance of different behaviors under different spatiotemporal resource dynamics can be tested. If adapted to fit empirical movement paths, methods described here could help reveal behavioral mechanisms of real animals and predict effects of anthropogenic landscape changes on animal movement.},

  abstract = {Movement of individual organisms is fundamental to life, quilting our planet in a rich tapestry of phenomena with diverse implications for ecosystems and humans. Movement research is both plentiful and insightful, and recent methodological advances facilitate obtaining a detailed view of individual movement. Yet, we lack a general unifying paradigm, derived from first principles, which can place movement studies within a common context and advance the development of a mature scientific discipline. This introductory article to the Movement Ecology Special Feature proposes a paradigm that integrates conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and empirical frameworks for studying movement of all organisms, from microbes to trees to elephants. We introduce a conceptual framework depicting the interplay among four basic mechanistic components of organismal movement: the internal state (why move?), motion (how to move?), and navigation (when and where to move?) capacities of the individual and the external factors affecting movement. We demonstrate how the proposed framework aids the study of various taxa and movement types; promotes the formulation of hypotheses about movement; and complements existing biomechanical, cognitive, random, and optimality paradigms of movement. The proposed framework integrates eclectic research on movement into a structured paradigm and aims at providing a basis for hypothesis generation and a vehicle facilitating the understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and spatiotemporal patterns of movement and their role in various ecological and evolutionary processes. ”Now we must consider in general the common reason for moving with any movement whatever.“ (Aristotle, De Motu Animalium, 4th century B.C.)},

In ecology, hot spots are often detected with a spatially global threshold, where a value for a given observation is compared with all values in a data set. When spatial relationships are important, spatially local definitions – those that compare the value for a given observation with locations in the vicinity, or the neighbourhood of the observation – provide a more explicit consideration of space. Here we outline spatial methods for hot spot detection: kernel estimation and local measures of spatial autocorrelation. To demonstrate these approaches, hot spots are detected in landscape level data on the magnitude of mountain pine beetle infestations. Using kernel estimators, we explore how selection of the neighbourhood size (τ) and hot spot threshold impact hot spot detection. We found that as τ increases, hot spots are larger and fewer; as the hot spot threshold increases, hot spots become larger and more plentiful and hot spots will reflect coarser scale spatial processes. The impact of spatial neighbourhood definitions on the delineation of hot spots identified with local measures of spatial autocorrelation was also investigated. In general, the larger the spatial neighbourhood used for analysis, the larger the area, or greater the number of areas, identified as hot spots.},

  abstract = {The coevolution of predators and prey has been the subject of much empirical and theoretical research that produced intriguing insights into the interplay of ecology and evolution. To allow for mathematical analysis, models of predator–prey coevolution are often coarse-grained, focussing on population-level processes and largely neglecting individual-level behaviour. As selection is acting on individual-level properties, we here present a more mechanistic approach: an individual-based simulation model for the coevolution of predators and prey on a fine-grained resource landscape, where features relevant for ecology (like changes in local densities) and evolution (like differences in survival and reproduction) emerge naturally from interactions between individuals. Our focus is on predator–prey movement behaviour, and we present a new method for implementing evolving movement strategies in an efficient and intuitively appealing manner. Throughout their lifetime, predators and prey make repeated movement decisions on the basis of their movement strategies. Over the generations, the movement strategies evolve, as individuals that successfully survive and reproduce leave their strategy to more descendants. We show that the movement strategies in our model evolve rapidly, thereby inducing characteristic spatial patterns like spiral waves and static spots. Transitions between these patterns occur frequently, induced by antagonistic coevolution rather than by external events. Regularly, evolution leads to the emergence and stable coexistence of qualitatively different movement strategies within the same population. Although the strategy space of our model is continuous, we often observe the evolution of discrete movement types. We argue that rapid evolution, coexistent movement types, and phase shifts between different ecological regimes are not a peculiarity of our model but a result of more realistic assumptions on eco-evolutionary feedbacks and the number of evolutionary degrees of freedom.},

In this paper we evaluate all components of adult fitness to assess the hypothesis that individuals distribute themselves among seven brood-rearing areas so that trade-offs among different life history traits result in equal mean fitness among individuals using different areas. We used estimates of vital rates (clutch size, nest survival, pre-fledging survival, post-fledging survival, juvenile survival, and breeding probability) to estimate brood-rearing-area-specific per capita recruitment rates and survival for adult females. We summed brood-rearing-area-specific per capita recruitment and adult survival to calculate brood-rearing-area-specific estimates of λ. We found little variation in λ among brood-rearing areas and lifetime fitness implications of changing brood-rearing area were negligible ({$<$}1\% brood-rearing area mean fitness). We conclude that adult female Black Brant distribute themselves in an ideal free manner, resulting in equal fitness among females using these areas.},

Previous efforts to understand and predict the coevolutionary dynamics of these interactions have generally assumed that standing genetic variation is fixed or absent altogether. We develop a genetically explicit model of coevolution that bridges the gap between these approaches by allowing genetic variation itself to evolve. Analysis of this model shows that the evolution of genetic variance has improtant consequences for the dyanmics and outcome of coevolution. Of particular importance is our demonstration that coevolutionary cycles can emerge in the absence of stabilizing selection, and outcome not possible in previous models of coevolution mediated by quantitative traits. whether coevolutionary cycles evolve depends upon the strength of selection, the number of loci, and the rate of mutation in each of the interacting species. Our results also generate novel predictions for the expected sign and magnitude of linkage disequilibria in each species.},

  abstract = {Optimality and game-theoretic models grounded in behavioral ecology have enjoyed increasing popularity in anthropology and prehistoric archaeology over the last three to four decades. They have been especially important to prehistorians in fostering the development of comprehensive, theoretically well-grounded expectations about past human behavior and in helping to identify testable explanations for its variation across time and space. Bliege Bird et al. (1) provide an example of this approach in their discussion of two game-theoretic models in an Australian ethnographic context. The results have important implications for reconstructing the process of hunter-gatherer dispersal across Sahul (Pleistocene Australia–New Guinea) and about changes in human subsistence during the Late Pleistocene and early Holocene.One of these models describes the ideal free distribution (IFD) of a population as it grows and spreads in an ecologically heterogeneous habitat (2). Applied specifically to hunter-gatherers, it assumes that patches within the habitat contain different sets of plant and animal foods offering different nutrient return rates to potential consumers. The model predicts that incoming population members will first occupy the patch where resources offer the highest aggregate rates, allowing them to gain the best overall return in the time available for collection. If resources are finite, consumers may deplete them. If returns from exploiting them fall below those available in other patches, some consumers will move to those patches. The process may continue until all patches are occupied and return rates across all are equal. It will be accelerated by population growth: Increasing numbers of consumers means more rapid resource depletion and related consumer dispersal across the overall habitat—a negative density-dependent scenario. In some situations, the opposite pattern may be apparent: Consumer presence may increase resource availability, an example of the Allee effect (3). Although the end result may be the same as in a simple IFD, … ↵1Email: oconnell\{at\}anthro.utah.edu.},

  abstract = {A series of prospective models is developed to investigate ideal free distributions in populations where individuals differ in competitive ability. The models are of three types. In the continuous-input models, there is continuous arrival of food or mates into each habitat patch, and competitors scramble to obtain as large a share as possible. In the interference models, the prey density in a particular patch stays constant but the presence of competitors slows down the rate at which prey are captured. In the kleptoparasitism model, individuals have food or females stolen from them by competitors higher in the dominance hierarchy, and in turn steal items from subordinates. A general result of the continuous-input and interference models is that the population of competitors can be truncated between patches so that the individuals with the highest competitive ability occur in the best patches, or in the patches where competitive differences are greatest. Individuals of lowest competitive ability occur in the poorest patches or where competitive differences are least, and intermediate phenotypes are ranked between these two extremes. Thus the ideal free prediction that all individuals will achieve equal fitness will not apply. However, in continuous-input cases where competitive differences between phenotypes remain constant across patches, this solution is only neutrally stable, and forms only one element of a set of equilibrium distributions. The fact that many empirical studies of continuous-input have found approximately equal mean fitness across patches may relate to this finding. Most interference studies contradict the simple ideal free solution by having different mean intake rates across patches; this may relate to the predicted positive correlation of competitive ability with patch quality. The kleptoparasitism model usually generated continuous cycling of individuals between habitat patches, though some correlation could be found between competitive ability and patch quality.},

  abstract = {[1. A simulation model is used to examine the spatial pattern of resource depletion imposed by vertebrates foraging in a heterogeneous environment; this may have important consequences for the dynamics of resource populations. It is assumed that consumers distribute themselves to maximize intake rates, that mutual interference occurs between competing consumers, and that the coefficient of interference, m, is less than one. 2. Where individuals are equal in their susceptibility to interference, depletion is density-dependent and variation in resource density is reduced towards zero. However, individuals often differ in their susceptibility to interference and incorporating such individual variation modifies the expected pattern of depletion. Spatial variation in resource density is no longer reduced to zero. After consumption of a given proportion of the total resource, spatial variation in the density of that remaining is greater when there is stronger interference, greater individual variation in susceptibility to interference, or a larger consumer population. With large individual variation and a large consumer population, domed or inversely density-dependent patterns of depletion are predicted, even where the coefficient of interference, m, is less than 1. 3. Field studies that quantify depletion of resource patches within the sampling range of a vertebrate population are reviewed and related to patterns predicted by the simulation model. The correlation between depletion and intial resource density is positive in 22 of 24 cases and significantly density-dependent (P{$<$}0.05) in 11 of these, while only one correlation is significantly inversely density-dependent. The mean correlation in a meta-analysis of vertebrate predators of invertebrate prey (22 cases) is significantly positive, showing that these groups tend to impose spatially density-dependent depletion. In contrast, reviews of invertebrate parasitoids find that inverse and positive density dependence are equally common. This difference may result partly from greater mobility of vertebrates, allowing them to sample the environment and distribute themselves closer to a rate-maximizing optimum. It is also possible that studies of vertebrates measure depletion at scales appropriate to the aggregative response of the consumers more frequently than studies of invertebrates.]},

  abstract = {A native asexual gecko, Lepidodactylus lugubris, declines numerically when the sexual gecko Hemidactylus frenatus invades urban/suburban habitats throughout the Pacific. Previous studies showed that the competitive displacement occurs rapidly and is facilitated by clumped insect resources. Five lines of evidence suggest that the mechanism of displacement is primarily due to differences in the ability of each species to exploit insect resources. (1) These species show nearly complete diet overlap. (2) Insects are a limiting resource for both geckos as evidenced by positive demographic effects with increased insect abundance. (3) Hemidactylus frenatus depletes insect resources to lower levels than L. lugubris, which results in reduced rates of resource acquisition in L. lugubris. (4) This reduced resource acquisition translates into significant reductions in the body condition, fecundity, and survivorship of L. lugubris individuals. (5) Evidence for interference (and other) mechanisms does not account for these negative demographic effects on L. lugubris. Interspecific competition is stronger than intraspecific competition for L. lugubris, with increasing L. lugubris density having negligible effect on H. frenatus, mirroring the asymmetry of the large—scale displacement. The superior harvesting ability of H. frenatus is most pronounced when insects are clumped spatially and temporally, and is attributable to a variety of species—specific traits such as their larger body size, faster running speed, and reduced intraspecific interference while foraging. We conclude that clumped resources can increase interspecific exploitation competition, and this mechanism may contribute to species turnover when human environmental alterations redistribute resources.},

  abstract = {In field experiments manipulating generalist pathogens and host community composition, the presence of a highly susceptible reservoir species drove disease dynamics in multiple nonreservoir species, sometimes decreasing their abundance through apparent competition. The dynamics of generalist pathogens in multispecies host communities remain a major frontier for disease ecology. Of particular interest are how host community structure controls pathogen transmission and how disease spread feeds back to influence the host community. Pathogen spillover occurs when epidemics in a host population are driven not by transmission within that population but by transmission from a reservoir population. Here we review examples of spillover in pathogens infecting humans, domesticated animals, and crops, noting that most empirical evidence for spillover results from nonmanipulative, observational studies. We then present results from two field experiments utilizing an experimentally tractable model system of annual wild grasses and a generalist virus, the barley yellow dwarf virus. In these experiments, the presence of a highly susceptible reservoir species, Avena fatua (wild oats), greatly increased pathogen prevalence in several other species. This result demonstrates pathogen spillover and illustrates the crucial role of host community structure in controlling the dynamics of generalist pathogens. Further, pathogen spillover from A. fatua decreased the abundance of two other host species through pathogen‐mediated apparent competition. Thus, our results provide experimental support for theoretical predictions of strong feedbacks between host community structure and generalist disease dynamics.},

  abstract = {Using techniques of stochastic theory, I develop a new aproach to predicting optimal diets. The models developed are for a mobile predator feeding on stationary prey; however, the models can easily be extended to include mobile prey. Parameters used in the models are caloric content, time to pursue and density of each prey type, and the speed of the predator. Both clumped and random prey distribution are considered. The models predict the optimal diet of a predator faced with a variety of potential prey types. The optimal diet is predicted as the set of successive prey choices which maximizes the rate of caloric intake or, alternatively, minimizes the time required to find a food ration. Also predicted are the criteria for specialization and switching from a specialist diet to a generalist diet. The criteria for specialization and for switching are independent of the density of the alternate prey type. Also, a predator feeding so as to maximize the rate of caloric intake should take a prey on every encounter with it or not take it at all. Thus, the model predicts that an animal feeding according to the dictates of the optimal diet should show no partial preferences. The role of predator satiation in affecting prey selection is discussed in light of the above findings. Criteria for optimal diet with clumped prey distributions are identical to the criteria in the case of random prey distributions except that the increased diameter of a prey clump leads to greater predator specialization. This arises because the prey become more conspicuous, thus reducing the time to search for prey. The relevance of this finding to pollinator specificity is discussed.},

We extend a model of ideally motivated populations to describe the local and regional consequences of interactions between three populations distinguished by their levels of cooperation and exploitation. Inspired by the classic prisoner's dilemma game, stereotypical fitness functions describe a baseline non-cooperative population whose per capita fitness decreases with density, obligate co-operators who initially benefit from the presence of conspecifics, and kleptoparasites who require heterospecifics to extract resources from the environment. We examine these populations in multiple combinations, determine where both local and regional coexistence is permitted, and investigate conditions under which one population will invade another. When they invade co-operators in resource-rich areas, kleptoparasites initiate a dynamic instability that leads to the loss of both populations; however, selfish hosts, who can persist at low densities, are immune to this risk. Furthermore, adaptive movement may delay the onset of instability as dispersal relieves dynamic stress. Selfish and cooperative populations default to mutual exclusion, but asymmetric variations in interference strength may relax this condition and permit limited sympatry within the environment. Distinct sub-communities characterize the overall spatial structure.},

  abstract = {A mathematical model is presented that describes a system where two consumer species compete exploitatively for a single renewable resource. The resource is distributed in a patchy but homogeneous environment; that is, all patches are intrinsically identical. The two consumer species are referred to as diggers and grazers, where diggers deplete the resource within a patch to lower densities than grazers. We show that the two distinct feeding strategies can produce a heterogeneous resource distribution that enables their coexistence. Coexistence requires that grazers must either move faster than diggers between patches or convert the resources to population growth much more efficiently than diggers. The model shows that the functional form of resource renewal within a patch is also important for coexistence. These results contrast with theory that considers exploitation competition for a single resource when the resource is assumed to be well mixed throughout the system.},

We present a computational framework and methodology for modeling small mammals as mobile agents making decisions during the dispersal process. It is shown how this object-oriented framework can accommodate the uncertainty of geographic information as well as the inherent fuzziness of the decision process. A fuzzy decision making model is presented along with its corresponding crisp equivalent. Using a realistic landscape, simulations are used to explore model behavior relative to fuzzy compensatory and noncompensatory aggregation operators. Simulations are used to compare fuzzy versus crisp model behaviors. Results are used to evaluate relative strengths and weaknesses of each. It is shown that this approach can be used for developing individual-based models to address spatially explicit ecological problems that are dependent on being based in a geographic information systems environment.},

  abstract = {Field studies of interference competition in free-living animals have relied on natural fluctuations in forager density, which are often confounded with other factors. We therefore experimentally studied interference in the wild, capitalizing on 2 cockle beds in an isolated bay that were exploited by a population of individually marked oystercatchers. We successfully increased forager density by chasing birds from one cockle bed, leaving the other cockle bed as the only nearby alternative. The density increase was most pronounced on the eastern cockle bed where food stocks were poorer and initial feeding densities were lower compared with the western cockle bed. Oystercatchers residing on this eastern bed suffered a significant decline in intake rate when bird density was experimentally increased, providing evidence of interference. “Refugee” birds, that is, the birds that were displaced from their home bed, experienced an even stronger reduction in intake rate compared with the residents and compared with their intake rate on their “home bed,” probably partly due to the fact that the refugee birds were forced to feed on an unfamiliar cockle bed. The fact that disturbance at 1 site influenced both the refugees and the local resident birds indicates that human disturbance (an important conservation issue) has an effect that extends beyond the site where the disturbance takes place. The benefits and costs of site fidelity and interference competition are likely to play an important role in understanding animal distributions and how they change in response to environmental perturbations, including human disturbance of foraging sites.},

We first demonstrate that the GA approach can provide a good match to analytic solutions to the original model. We demonstrate that a GA can be used to find the evolutionarily stable strategies in a model relevant to behavioural ecology where the fitness of each strategy is determined by the frequencies of different strategies in the population. We argue that the GA implementation demonstrates the combination of assumptions used to generate analytic solution to the original model can only be simultaneously satisfied under relatively restrictive conditions on the ecology of the species involved; specifically that group membership is very fluid but group size is conserved over timescales of individual foraging bouts. We further explore the sensitivity of model predictions to alternative choices in the implementation of the GA, and present advice for implementation and presentation of similar models. In particular, we emphasise the need for care in measuring the predictions of such models, so as to capture the intrinsic behaviour of the system and not the remnant of often arbitrarily chosen initial conditions. We also emphasise the potential for GA models to be more transparent about model assumptions regarding underlying biology than analytic models.},

Individuals in selfish herds are thought to benefit by reducing their own risk at the expense of conspecifics by attracting toward their neighbors’ positions1,2 or central locations in the aggregation.3, 4, 5 Alternatively, increased alignment with their neighbors’ orientation could reduce the chance of predation through information sharing6, 7, 8 or collective escape.6 Using both small and large flocks of homing pigeons (Columba livia; n~= 8–10 or n~= 27–34 individuals) tagged with 5-Hz GPS loggers and a GPS-tagged, remote-controlled model peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), we tested whether individuals increase their use of attraction over alignment when under perceived threat. We conducted n~= 27 flights in treatment conditions, chased by the robotic “predator,” and n~= 16 flights in control conditions (not chased). Despite responding strongly to the RobotFalcon—by turning away from its flight direction—individuals in treatment flocks demonstrated no increased attraction compared with control flocks, and this result held across both flock sizes. We suggest that mutualistic alignment is more advantageous than selfish attraction in groups with a high coincidence of individual and collective interests (adaptive hypothesis). However, we also explore alternative explanations, such as high cognitive demand under threat and collision avoidance (mechanistic hypotheses). We conclude that selfish herd may not be an appropriate paradigm for understanding the function of highly synchronous collective motion, as observed in bird flocks and perhaps also fish shoals and highly aligned mammal aggregations, such as moving herds.},

These adaptive behavioural strategies are complex and can only be fully understood (and predicted) within the framework of natural selection in which species adopt evolutionary stable strategies. We present sOAR, a powerful and user-friendly implementation of the well-established framework of optimal annual routine modelling. It allows determining optimal animal life history strategies under cyclic environmental conditions using stochastic dynamic programming. It further includes the simulation of population dynamics under the optimal strategy. sOAR provides an important tool for theoretical studies on the behavioural and evolutionary ecology of animals. It is especially suited for studying bird migration. In particular, we integrated options to differentiate between costs of active and passive flight into the optimal annual routine modelling framework, as well as options to consider periodic wind conditions affecting flight energetics. We provide an illustrative example of sOAR where food supply in the wintering habitat of migratory birds significantly alters the optimal timing of migration. sOAR helps improving our understanding of how complex behaviours evolve and how behavioural decisions are constrained by internal and external factors experienced by the animal. Such knowledge is crucial for anticipating potential species’ response to global environmental change.},

  abstract = {Understanding host–pathogen dynamics requires realistic consideration of transmission events that, in the case of directly transmitted pathogens, result from contacts between susceptible and infected individuals. The corresponding contact rates are usually heterogeneous due to variation in individual movement patterns and the underlying landscape structure. However, in epidemiological models, the roles that explicit host movements and landscape structure play in shaping contact rates are often overlooked. We adapted an established agent-based model of classical swine fever (CSF) in wild boar Sus scrofa to investigate how explicit representation of landscape heterogeneity and host movement between social groups affects invasion and persistence probabilities. We simulated individual movement both phenomenologically as a correlated random walk (CRW) and mechanistically by representing interactions of the moving individuals with the landscape and host population structure. The effect of landscape structure on the probability of invasion success and disease persistence depended remarkably on the way host movement is simulated and the case fatality ratio associated with the pathogen strain. The persistence probabilities were generally low with CRW which ignores feedbacks to external factors. Although the basic reproduction number R0, a measure of the contagiousness of an infectious disease, was kept constant, these probabilities were up to eight times higher under mechanistic movement rules, especially in heterogeneous landscapes. The increased persistence emerged due to important feedbacks of the directed movement on the spatial variation of host density, contact rates and transmission events to distant areas. Our findings underscore the importance of accounting for spatial context and group size structures in eco-epidemiological models. Our study highlights that the simulation of explicit, mechanistic movement behaviour can reverse predictions of disease persistence in comparison to phenomenological rules such as random walk approaches. This can have severe consequences when predicting the probability of disease persistence and assessing control measures to prevent outbreaks.},

There are three advantages of assessing and responding to patchiness at smaller scales. First, an environment may be rendered profitable only when the forager can separate areas of low and high resource abundance. Second, by placing accurate boundaries on profitable food patches, foragers can eliminate the "cost" of over- and underestimating patch size. Third, by biasing search efforts toward rich food patches, the forager can harvest more resources in the same amount of time. We investigate the ability of fox squirrels, Sciurus niger, to detect patchiness at small spatial scales, using experimental food patches subdivided into micropatches. We manipulated micropatch size, food density, and the occurrence of distinct versus vague boundaries. In accord with the theory, increasing the proportion of vague boundaries increased assessment error, while increasing resource density decreased assessment error. Halving patch size combined with doubling resource density had no effect on assessment error. These results indicate that assessing patch size/boundaries is as important as assessing resource density at some scales of patchiness. Other foraging costs, such as predation risk and metabolic costs, may contribute to assessment errors.},

As a result, modeling coevolutionary processes solely in terms of mean trait values may not be sufficient; one may need to study the dynamics of the whole trait distribution. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for studying the effects of evolving intraspecific variation in two-species coevolutionary systems. In particular, we build and study mathematical models of competition, exploiter-victim interactions, and mutualism in which the strength of within- and between-species interactions depends on the difference in continuously varying traits between individuals reproducing asexually. We use analytical approximations based on the invasion analysis and supplement them with numerical results. We find that intraspecific variation can be maintained if stabilizing selection is weak in at least one species. When intraspecific variation is maintained under competition or mutualism, coexistence in a stable equilibrium is promoted when between-species interactions mostly happen between individuals similar in trait values. In contrast, in exploiter-victim systems coexistence typically requires strong interactions between dissimilar exploiters and victims. We show that trait distributions can become multimodal. Our approach and results contribute to the understanding of the ecological consequences of intraspecific variation in coevolutionary systems by exploring its effects on population densities and trait distributions.},

  abstract = {Animal movement comes in a variety of ‘types’ including small foraging movements, larger one-way dispersive movements, seasonally-predictable round-trip migratory movements, and erratic nomadic movements. Although most individuals move at some point throughout their lives, movement patterns can vary widely across individuals within the same species: differing within an individual over time (intra-individual), among individuals in the same population (inter-individual), or among populations (inter-population). Yet, studies of movement (theoretical and empirical alike) more often focus on understanding ‘typical’ movement patterns than understanding variation in movement. Here, I synthesize current knowledge of movement variation (drawing parallels across species and movement types), describing the causes (what factors contribute to individual variation), patterns (what movement variation looks like), consequences (why variation matters), maintenance (why variation persists), implications (for management and conservation), and finally gaps (what pieces we are currently missing). By synthesizing across scales of variation, I span across work on plasticity, personality, and geographic variation. Individual movement can be driven by factors that act at the individual, population, community and ecosystem level and have ramifications at each of these levels. Generally the consequences of movement are less well understood than the causes, in part because the effects of movement variation are often nested, with variation manifesting at the population level, which in turn affects communities and ecosystems. Understanding both cause and consequence is particularly important for predicting when variation begets variation in a positive feedback loop, versus when a negative feedback causes variation to be dampened successively. Finally, maintaining standing variation in movement may be important for facilitating species’ ability to respond to future environmental change.},

  abstract = {Ecosystems’ responses to changing environmental conditions can be modulated by spatial self-organization. A prominent example of this can be found in drylands, where formation of vegetation patterns attenuates the magnitude of degradation events in response to decreasing rainfall. In model studies, the pattern wavelength responds to changing conditions, which is reflected by a rather gradual decline in biomass in response to decreasing rainfall. Although these models are spatially explicit, they have adopted a mean-field approach to grazing. By taking into account spatial variability when modeling grazing, we find that (over)grazing can lead to a dramatic shift in biomass, so that degradation occurs at rainfall rates that would otherwise still maintain a relatively productive ecosystem. Moreover, grazing increases the resilience of degraded ecosystem states. Consequently, restoration of degraded ecosystems could benefit from the introduction of temporary small-scale exclosures to escape from the basin of attraction of degraded states.},

  abstract = {Advances in tracking technology have led to an exponential increase in animal location data, greatly enhancing our ability to address interesting questions in movement ecology, but also presenting new challenges related to data management and analysis. Step-selection functions (SSFs) are commonly used to link environmental covariates to animal location data collected at fine temporal resolution. SSFs are estimated by comparing observed steps connecting successive animal locations to random steps, using a likelihood equivalent of a Cox proportional hazards model. By using common statistical distributions to model step length and turn angle distributions, and including habitat- and movement-related covariates (functions of distances between points, angular deviations), it is possible to make inference regarding habitat selection and movement processes or to control one process while investigating the other. The fitted model can also be used to estimate utilization distributions and mechanistic home ranges. Here, we present the R package amt (animal movement tools) that allows users to fit SSFs to data and to simulate space use of animals from fitted models. The amt package also provides tools for managing telemetry data. Using fisher (Pekania pennanti) data as a case study, we illustrate a four-step approach to the analysis of animal movement data, consisting of data management, exploratory data analysis, fitting of models, and simulating from fitted models.},

  abstract = {Recent studies suggest that populations and species often exhibit behavioral syndromes; that is, suites of correlated behaviors across situations. An example is an aggression syndrome where some individuals are more aggressive, whereas others are less aggressive across a range of situations and contexts. The existence of behavioral syndromes focuses the attention of behavioral ecologists on limited (less than optimal) behavioral plasticity and behavioral carryovers across situations, rather than on optimal plasticity in each isolated situation. Behavioral syndromes can explain behaviors that appear strikingly non-adaptive in an isolated context (e.g. inappropriately high activity when predators are present, or excessive sexual cannibalism). Behavioral syndromes can also help to explain the maintenance of individual variation in behavioral types, a phenomenon that is ubiquitous, but often ignored. Recent studies suggest that the behavioral type of an individual, population or species can have important ecological and evolutionary implications, including major effects on species distributions, on the relative tendencies of species to be invasive or to respond well to environmental change, and on speciation rates. Although most studies of behavioral syndromes to date have focused on a few organisms, mainly in the laboratory, further work on other species, particularly in the field, should yield numerous new insights.},

Ideal-free distribution theory assumes that in a patchy environment foragers maximize fitness and hence their feeding rate by balancing gains from more food against losses from more competition. Ultimately, individuals cannot increase their feeding rate by moving to another patch and they distribute themselves over patches in proportion to prey density per patch. 2. In our experiments with shore crabs Carcinus maenas foraging on two adjacent patches with mussels Mytilus edulis, the implicit assumption of ideal-free distribution theory that catch should match time spent in a prey patch is not met, however. Despite aggregating their attack where it is most profitable shore crabs distributed themselves homogeneously across mussel patches: they ‘take away’ the prey caught and consume it elsewhere to reduce interference. 3. Thus, predator distributions can be quite different from prey-attack distributions. This is important because the latter is shown to be decisive for persistence of predator and prey populations in ecological models.},

The four statistics are tested by a biological simulation model from population genetics in which a population lives on a 21 × 21 lattice of stepping stones (sixty-four individuals per stone) and reproduces and disperses over a number of generations. Some designs model global spatial autocorrelation, others spatially random surfaces. We find that spatially random designs give reliable test results by permutational methods of testing significance. Globally autocorrelated designs do not fit expectations by any of the three tests we employed. Asymptotic methods of testing significance failed consistently, regardless of design. Because most biological data sets are autocorrelated, significance testing for local spatial autocorrelation is problematic. However, the statistics are informative when employed in an exploratory manner. We found that hotspots (positive local autocorrelation) and coldspots (negative local autocorrelation) are successfully distinguished in spatially autocorrelated, biologically plausible data sets.},

  abstract = {Kleptoparasitism (food stealing) is a significant behavior for animals that forage in social groups as it permits some individuals to obtain resources while avoiding the costs of searching for their own food. Evolutionary game theory has been used to model kleptoparasitism, with a series of differential equation-based compartmental models providing significant theoretical insights into behavior in kleptoparasitic populations. In this paper, we apply this compartmental modeling approach to kleptoparasitic behavior in a real foraging population of urban gulls (Laridae). Field data was collected on kleptoparasitism and a model developed that incorporated the same kleptoparasitic and defensive strategies available to the study population. Two analyses were conducted: 1) An assessment of whether the density of each behavior in the population was at an equilibrium. 2) An investigation of whether individual foragers were using Evolutionarily Stable Strategies in the correct environmental conditions. The results showed the density of different behaviors in the population could be at an equilibrium at plausible values for handling time and fight duration. Individual foragers used aggressive kleptoparasitic strategies effectively in the correct environmental conditions but some individuals in those same conditions failed to defend food items. This was attributed to the population being composed of 3 species that differed in competitive ability. These competitive differences influenced the strategies that individuals were able to use. Rather than gulls making poor behavioral decisions these results suggest a more complex 3-species model is required to describe the behavior of this population.},

Individual differences in movement and space-use, fundamental to many personality traits (e.g. activity, boldness and exploratory behaviour) have been documented across many species and contexts, for instance personality-dependent dispersal syndromes. Yet, insights from the concurrently developing movement ecology paradigm are rarely considered and recent evidence for other personality-dependent movements and space-use lack a general unifying framework. We propose a conceptual framework for personality-dependent spatial ecology. We link expectations derived from the movement ecology paradigm with behavioural reaction-norms to offer specific predictions on the interactions between environmental factors, such as resource distribution or landscape structure, and intrinsic behavioural variation. We consider how environmental heterogeneity and individual consistency in movements that carry-over across spatial scales can lead to personality-dependent: (1) foraging search performance; (2) habitat preference; (3) home range utilization patterns; (4) social network structure and (5) emergence of assortative population structure with spatial clusters of personalities. We support our conceptual model with spatially explicit simulations of behavioural variation in space-use, demonstrating the emergence of complex population-level patterns from differences in simple individual-level behaviours. Consideration of consistent individual variation in space-use will facilitate mechanistic understanding of processes that drive social, spatial, ecological and evolutionary dynamics in heterogeneous environments.},

  abstract = {Interspecific kleptoparasitism (food stealing) occurs in many seabird species and can sometimes significantly affect host individuals and populations. We investigated effects of kleptoparasitism by Glaucous-winged Gulls (Larus glaucescens) on a population of Tufted Puffins (Fratercula cirrhata) in which almost all chicks die before fledging in some years. Rates of kleptoparasitism were estimated during two seasons and compared with several spatial and temporal factors that have been predicted to influence kleptoparasitism rates both within and among seasons. Kleptoparasitism rates increased from 2\% in the first year to 19\% in the second, whereas puffin fledging success declined precipitously from 81\% in the first year to 11\% in the second. Within years, kleptoparasitism rates increased with number of puffins returning with fish, decreased during fair weather, and were unaffected by tidal height. Spatially, those rates increased with puffin burrow density and declined with angle of the nesting slope. Gull kleptoparasitism success increased during foul weather and at higher puffin nesting elevations. Despite those associations, survival of puffin chicks was not influenced by kleptoparasitism activity near their nests although it increased with a combination of low elevation and high slope at the nesting burrow. Neither kleptoparasitism nor predation by gulls were exceptional relative to other seabird colonies and they were unlikely to cause reproductive failures that characterize puffins at that site. Other factors, particularly food shortages at sea, merit further attention in explaining those failures.},

  abstract = {Conservation objectives for non-breeding coastal birds (shorebirds and wildfowl) are determined from their population size at coastal sites. To advise coastal managers, models must predict quantitatively the effects of environmental change on population size or the demographic rates (mortality and reproduction) that determine it. As habitat association models and depletion models are not able to do this, we developed an approach that has produced such predictions thereby enabling policy makers to make evidence-based decisions. Our conceptual framework is individual-based ecology, in which populations are viewed as having properties (e.g. size) that arise from the traits (e.g. behaviour, physiology) and interactions of their constituent individuals. The link between individuals and populations is made through individual-based models (IBMs) that follow the fitness-maximising decisions of individuals and predict population-level consequences (e.g. mortality rate) from the fates of these individuals. Our first IBM was for oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus and accurately predicted their density-dependent mortality. Subsequently, IBMs were developed for several shorebird and wildfowl species at several European sites, and were shown to predict accurately overwinter mortality, and the foraging behaviour from which predictions are derived. They have been used to predict the effect on survival in coastal birds of sea level rise, habitat loss, wind farm development, shellfishing and human disturbance. This review emphasises the wider applicability of the approach, and identifies other systems to which it could be applied. We view the IBM approach as a very useful contribution to the general problem of how to advance ecology to the point where we can routinely make meaningful predictions of how populations respond to environmental change.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of resource patches and species that exploit such patches are of interest to ecologists, conservation biologists, modelers, and mathematicians. Here we consider how social interactions can create unique, evolving patterns in space and time. Whereas simple prey taxis (with consumable prey) promotes spatial uniform distributions, here we show that taxis in producer–scrounger groups can lead to pattern formation. We consider two types of foragers: those that search directly (“producers”) and those that exploit other foragers to find food (“scroungers” or exploiters). We show that such groups can sustain fluctuating spatiotemporal patterns, akin to “waves of pursuit.” Investigating the relative benefits to the individuals, we observed conditions under which either strategy leads to enhanced success, defined as net food consumption. Foragers that search for food directly have an advantage when food patches are localized. Those that seek aggregations of group mates do better when their ability to track group mates exceeds the foragers’ food-sensing acuity. When behavioral switching or reproductive success of the strategies is included, the relative abundance of foragers and exploiters is dynamic over time, in contrast with classic models that predict stable frequencies. Our work shows the importance of considering two-way interaction—i.e., how food distribution both influences and is influenced by social foraging and aggregation of predators.},

  abstract = {Restrictions on roaming Until the past century or so, the movement of wild animals was relatively unrestricted, and their travels contributed substantially to ecological processes. As humans have increasingly altered natural habitats, natural animal movements have been restricted. Tucker et al. examined GPS locations for more than 50 species. In general, animal movements were shorter in areas with high human impact, likely owing to changed behaviors and physical limitations. Besides affecting the species themselves, such changes could have wider effects by limiting the movement of nutrients and altering ecological interactions. Science, this issue p. 466 Animal movement is fundamental for ecosystem functioning and species survival, yet the effects of the anthropogenic footprint on animal movements have not been estimated across species. Using a unique GPS-tracking database of 803 individuals across 57 species, we found that movements of mammals in areas with a comparatively high human footprint were on average one-half to one-third the extent of their movements in areas with a low human footprint. We attribute this reduction to behavioral changes of individual animals and to the exclusion of species with long-range movements from areas with higher human impact. Global loss of vagility alters a key ecological trait of animals that affects not only population persistence but also ecosystem processes such as predator-prey interactions, nutrient cycling, and disease transmission. Human alterations of the landscape shorten the distances traveled by individual animals. Human alterations of the landscape shorten the distances traveled by individual animals.},

  abstract = {The relationship between movement and population dynamics in heterogeneous environments has been approached from two directions: theoretical analyses using diffusion models and empirical studies that often employ computer simulations. In this paper I am proposing a unified framework for studying individual movements that brings both of these approaches together. The proposed framework is based on the diffusion—approximation' procedure developed by Patlak (1953a, b), which translates a probabilistic description of the pattern of individual movements (such as provided by simulation models) into a partial differential model describing the population redistribution in a patchy habitat. My first goal is this paper was to make Patlak's work accessible to ecologists interested in realistic movement models. Secondly, making some simplifying assumptions I solved Patlick's model to obtain the equilibrium distribution of organisms among patches in a heterogeneous environment. This led me to a definition of 'residence index.' The residence index of a patch is estimated by observing and recording movement trajectories of organisms within the patch. The pattern of variation in the residence index among different kinds of patches specifies the predicted equilibrium densities of organisms in each patch. I assessed the utility of the above approach by using data on movement tracks of Euphydryas anicia females to calculate butterfly residence indices in host—plant patches vs. nonhost environment. The predicted distribution of butterflies among host and nonhost areas differed by only 16\% from the actual distribution, as documented by an independent data set. I also applied the model to data from three studies on insect movement and spatial distribution. The accuracy of model predictions varied from adequate to excellent. Finally, I argue that Patlak's model and its residence—index extension provides a general, and at the same time realistic, framework for quantifying individual movements, and for relating movement patterns to spatial population dynamics. Although this approach, as developed here, is explicitly concerned only with population redistribution within an area, birth/death or immigration/emigration terms can be added in a straightforward manner. Thus, this framework can be very useful in studies of consumer—resource (e.g., predator—prey or herbivore—host) spatial dynamics, since movement behaviors of consumers searching for prey, and prey attempting to avoid consumers, are known to be important in affecting the outcome of such population interactions.},

  abstract = {Studies of interference competition among foraging animals generally assume that variation in the spatial distribution of food can be neglected. This assumption may be problematic as resource defence experiments suggest that such variation is of the essence in some interference mechanisms. Interpretation of the results of field experiments on this topic, however, is hard because most studies used univariate statistics to analyse multivariate data. Because in free-living foragers interference and patch selection are connected behaviours, treatment effects on these responses are best studied simultaneously, through multivariate analyses. We performed a field experiment in which we provided wild ruddy turnstones, Arenaria interpres, with experimental plots that varied in the distance between a fixed number of so-called food pits, and, using multivariate statistics, we studied effects on the combination of the turnstones' behaviour and abundance. We found that when food pits were more spaced out, turnstones were present in higher numbers, while interacting less with each other. Nevertheless, turnstones spent about the same amount of time digging for food, our measure of intake rate, at each interpit distance. These findings imply that to reliably predict the combination of the number, intake rate and aggression of turnstones, the spatial distribution of food has to be known. We would not have reached this conclusion if we had used univariate statistics. In addition, we argue that multivariate statistics helps to clarify the way field experiments on the spatial distribution of food are to be interpreted.},

Our knowledge about interactions between migrating birds, thermal selection during migration and mechanisms that lead to flocking or convergent travel networks is still very limited. To start investigating these aspects we developed an individual-based simulation model that describes the local interactions between birds and their environment during their migratory flight, leading to emergent patterns at larger scales. The aim of our model is to identify likely decision rules with respect to thermal selection and navigation. After explaining the model, it is applied to analyse the migration of white storks (Ciconia ciconia) over part of its migration domain. A model base-run is accompanied by a sensitivity analysis. It appears that social interactions lead to the use of fewer thermals and slight increases in distance travelled. Possibilities for different model extensions and further model application are discussed.}

We show that these three strategies can coexist only in the unlikely case that the opportunist's loss in searching ability is exactly equal to its gain in scrounging ability. However, all pairs of strategies can coexist. Three parameters control the proportions of coexisting strategists: the degree of compatibility between the opportunist's producing and scrounging activities; the proportion of food patches that are shared with scrounging individuals; and the effective group size. When there is little incompatibility between producing and scrounging, opportunists will always be present, unless the producer is able to consume most of the patch without sharing. The opportunist strategy is always excluded when there is a high degree of incompatibility between producing and scrounging. We consider the organismal and ecological factors that are likely to affect all three parameters. Our model predicts that scrounging behavior is likely to be selected in a wide range of foraging groups and that it may impose a considerable cost on sociality.},

Our simulated data were obtained from a relative-motion, biased random-walk (RM-BRW) model with attraction and repulsion circumferences. Our empirical data were GPS relocation time series collected from African elephants in Etosha National Park, Namibia. The simulated data were primarily used to validate our method while the empirical data analysis were used to illustrate the types of behavioral assessment that our methodology reveals.Our methodology facilitates automated, observer-bias-free analysis of the locomotive interactions of dyads using GPS relocation data, which is becoming increasingly ubiquitous as telemetry and related technologies improve. Our method should open up a whole new vista of behavioral-interaction type analyses to movement and behavioral ecologists.},

Inventive Minds assembles a group of authors well equipped to address this question: contemporary inventors of important new technologies, historians of science and industry, and cognitive psychologists interested in the process of creativity. In telling their stories, the inventors describe the origins of such remarkable devices as ultrasound, the electron microscope, and artificial diamonds. The historians help us look into the minds of innovators like Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, Michael Faraday, and the Wright brothers, drawing on original notebooks and other sources to show how they made their key discoveries. Finally, cognitive psychologists explore the mental processes that figure in creative thinking. Contributing to the authors' insight is their special focus on the "front end" of invention -- where ideas come from and how they are transformed into physical prototypes. They answer three questions: How does invention happen? How does invention contrast with other commonly creative pursuits such as scientific inquiry, musical composition, or painting? And how might invention best happen -- that is, what kinds of settings, conditions, and strategies appear to foster inventive activity? The book yields a wealth of information that will make absorbing reading for cognitive and social psychologists, social historians, and many working scientists and general readers who are interested in the psychology of personality and the roots of ingenuity.},

  abstract = {Disease models have provided conflicting evidence as to whether spatial heterogeneity promotes or impedes pathogen persistence. Moreover, there has been limited theoretical investigation into how animal movement behavior interacts with the spatial organization of resources (e.g., clustered, random, uniform) across a landscape to affect infectious disease dynamics. Importantly, spatial heterogeneity of resources can sometimes lead to nonlinear or counterintuitive outcomes depending on the host and pathogen system. There is a clear need to develop a general theoretical framework that could be used to create testable predictions for specific host–pathogen systems. Here, we develop an individual-based model integrated with movement ecology approaches to investigate how host movement behaviors interact with landscape heterogeneity (in the form of various levels of resource abundance and clustering) to affect pathogen dynamics. For most of the parameter space, our results support the counterintuitive idea that fragmentation promotes pathogen persistence, but this finding was largely dependent on perceptual range of the host, conspecific density, and recovery rate. For simulations with high conspecific density, slower recovery rates, and larger perceptual ranges, more complex disease dynamics emerged, and the most fragmented landscapes were not necessarily the most conducive to outbreaks or pathogen persistence. These results point to the importance of interactions between landscape structure, individual movement behavior, and pathogen transmission for predicting and understanding disease dynamics.},

  abstract = {Although 'personalities' such as boldness, aggressive behaviour and risk avoidance have been shown to exist in more than sixty animal species, from primates to ants, explaining their existence in terms of evolution has been a puzzle. Surely, evolution should not favour the maintenance of different personalities, but rather the convergence towards a single one. In a numerical life-history model, Wolf et al. show that the evolution of animal personalities, defined as consistent sets of behaviours shown in a variety of contexts, is related to an adaptive response to life-history trade-offs. In this model, decisions on trade-offs between current and future reproduction condition the response of individuals to risky situations, and this may be the basis for animal personalities and their maintenance in populations.},

  abstract = {We develop a conceptual framework for the understanding of animal personalities in terms of adaptive evolution. We focus on two basic questions. First, why do behavioural types exhibit limited behavioural plasticity, that is, behavioural correlations both across contexts and over time? Second, how can multiple behavioural types coexist within a single population? We emphasize differences in ‘state’ among individuals in combination with state-dependent behaviour. Some states are inherently stable and individual differences in such states can explain stable differences in suites of behaviour if it is adaptive to make behaviour in various contexts dependent on such states. Behavioural stability and cross-context correlations in behaviour are more difficult to explain if individual states are potentially more variable. In such cases stable personalities can result from state-dependent behaviour if state and behaviour mutually reinforce each other by feedback mechanisms. We discuss various evolutionary mechanisms for the maintenance of variation (in states and/or behaviour), including frequency-dependent selection, spatial variation with incomplete matching between habitat and phenotype, bet-hedging in a temporally fluctuating environment, and non-equilibrium dynamics. Although state differences are important, we also discuss how social conventions and social signalling can give rise to adaptive personality differences in the absence of state differences.},

  abstract = {Personality differences are a widespread phenomenon throughout the animal kingdom. Past research has focused on the characterization of such differences and a quest for their proximate and ultimate causation. However, the consequences of these differences for ecology and evolution received much less attention. Here, we strive to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive inventory of the potential implications of personality differences, ranging from population growth and persistence to species interactions and community dynamics, and covering issues such as social evolution, the speed of evolution, evolvability, and speciation. The emerging picture strongly suggests that personality differences matter for ecological and evolutionary processes (and their interaction) and, thus, should be considered a key dimension of ecologically and evolutionarily relevant intraspecific variation.},

  abstract = {Personality differences can be found in a wide range of species across the animal                     kingdom, but why natural selection gave rise to such differences remains an open                     question. Frequency-dependent selection is a potent mechanism explaining                     variation; it does not explain, however, the other two key features associated                     with personalities, consistency and correlations. Using the hawk-dove game and a                     frequency-dependent foraging game as examples, we here show that this changes                     fundamentally whenever one takes into account the physiological architecture                     underlying behavior (e.g., metabolism). We find that the inclusion of physiology                     changes the evolutionary predictions concerning consistency and correlations:                     while selection gives rise to inconsistent individuals and stochastically                     fluctuating behavioral correlations in scenarios that neglect physiology, we                     find high levels of behavioral consistency and tight and stable trait                     correlations in scenarios that incorporate physiology. The coevolution of                     behavioral and physiological traits also gives rise to adaptive physiological                     differences that are systematically associated with behavioral differences. As                     well as providing a framework for understanding behavioral consistency and                     behavioral correlations, our work thus also provides an explanation for                     systematic physiological differences within populations, a phenomenon that                     appears to exist in a wide range of species but that, up to now, has been poorly                     understood.}

  abstract = {Kleptoparasitism involves the theft of resources such as food items from one individual by another. Such food-stealing behaviour can have important consequences for birds, in terms of individual fitness and population sizes. In order to understand avian host–kleptoparasite interactions, studies are needed which identify the factors which modulate the risk of kleptoparasitism. In temperate European intertidal areas, Eurasian oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus feed primarily on bivalve molluscs, which may be stolen by kleptoparasitic species such as carrion crows Corvus corone and herring gulls Larus argentatus. In this study we combined overwinter foraging observations of oystercatchers and their kleptoparasites on the Exe Estuary, UK, with statistical modelling to identify the factors that influence the likelihood of successful food stealing behaviour occurring. Across the winter, 16.4\% of oystercatcher foraging attempts ended in successful kleptoparasitism; the risk of theft was lowest in February (10.8\%) and highest in December (36.3\%). Using an information theoretic approach to compare multiple logistic regression models we present evidence that the outcome of host foraging attempts varied with the number of kleptoparasites per host within the foraging patch for two out of five individual months, and for all months grouped. Successful, kleptoparasitism was more likely to occur when the total number of all kleptoparasites per host was greater. Across the entire winter study period, oystercatcher foraging attempts that resulted in kleptoparasitism were associated with a mean number of kleptoparasites per host that was more than double that for foraging attempts that ended in the oystercatcher successfully consuming the mussel. Conversely, the stage of the tidal cycle within the estuary did not affect the outcome of oystercatcher foraging attempts. Our study provides evidence that bird numbers influence the risk of kleptoparasitism within avian assemblages.},

  abstract = {Density regulation influences population dynamics through its effects on demographic rates and consequently constitutes a key mechanism explaining the response of organisms to environmental changes. Yet, it is difficult to establish the exact form of density dependence from empirical data. Here, we developed an individual-based model to explore how resource limitation and behavioural processes determine the spatial structure of white stork Ciconia ciconia populations and regulate reproductive rates. We found that the form of density dependence differed considerably between landscapes with the same overall resource availability and between home range selection strategies, highlighting the importance of fine-scale resource distribution in interaction with behaviour. In accordance with theories of density dependence, breeding output generally decreased with density but this effect was highly variable and strongly affected by optimal foraging strategy, resource detection probability and colonial behaviour. Moreover, our results uncovered an overlooked consequence of density dependence by showing that high early nestling mortality in storks, assumed to be the outcome of harsh weather, may actually result from density dependent effects on food provision. Our findings emphasize that accounting for interactive effects of individual behaviour and local environmental factors is crucial for understanding density-dependent processes within spatially structured populations. Enhanced understanding of the ways animal populations are regulated in general, and how habitat conditions and behaviour may dictate spatial population structure and demographic rates is critically needed for predicting the dynamics of populations, communities and ecosystems under changing environmental conditions.},
